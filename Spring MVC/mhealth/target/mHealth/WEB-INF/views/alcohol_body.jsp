          			 <p>Understanding how alcohol is absorbed and processed by the
						body can be useful for understanding alcohol's effects. When you
						swallow a drink, the alcohol travels to your stomach, where some
						of it is absorbed. The rest of the alcohol travels to the small
						intestine, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. The rate of
						absorption is important, because faster absorption means getting
						drunk faster. In general, rate of absorption will be affected by
						how fast you drink, how concentrated the alcohol is (i.e.,
						straight shots will be absorbed faster than beer or mixed drinks),
						the presence of food in the stomach, and your total blood volume.
						Although absorption rate can be slowed by eating while drinking or
						by drinking less concentrated alcohol, all the alcohol will
						eventually get into your system. Once the alcohol is absorbed, it
						will travel to all parts of the body, affecting everything from
						hunger to heart rate to brain functioning. Depending on amount,
						alcohol can cause relaxation, unconsciousness, or death. 
						</p><p>
						More than 90% of alcohol in your blood is removed by your liver through a
						process called oxidation. Less than 10% of alcohol is removed
						through sweat, breath, or urine. The liver gets rid of about one
						"drink" per hour from the body, which is slower than how much
						alcohol can be put into your body. There is no way to get rid of
						the alcohol in your body faster. Coffee or cold showers will not
						sober up people-the alcohol is still there. The alcohol is
						broken down into acetaldehyde, a poison, which is rapidly
						converted into acetate, and finally into carbon dioxide and water,
						which then filters through the kidneys and eventually leave as
						urine. Alcohol broken down releases energy (calories) but does not
						have any significant nutritional value. The alcohol is often
						stored in fat in the body-this is why people talk about "beer
						bellies". One beer often has as many calories as a hot dog: six
						beers = six hot dogs.</p>

  <div id="demo4" class="collapse">
      
      <div>				
      				 <p>Have you ever wondered why alcohol affects people
						differently? And why some people are affected differently from one
						time to the next? Alcohol, for example, can sometimes make people
						hostile and aggressive, and at other times friendly and warm; it
						can relieve tension and anxiety and yet at other times increase
						irritability and stress. 
						</p><p>
						One model for understanding these
						differences is that alcohol intoxication leads to a myopia in our
						ability to perceive and process information. "Myopia" means
						nearsightedness, which causes people to have trouble seeing things
						off in the distance or off to the side. Alcohol intoxication seems
						to produce nearsightedness in our thinking: alcohol makes our
						world smaller by reducing our awareness of what is happening
						around us when we drink. The more you drink the less aware you
						become.
						</p><p>
						When sober, people typically think quickly, drawing on
						lots of information. Laboratory studies on alcohol have shown that
						heavy drinking limits our ability to think and our awareness of
						what is happening around us. Like nearsightedness, alcohol causes
						us to only see what is happening right in front of us right now.
						Alcohol does not allow us to think about complex things when we
						are intoxicated.
						</p><p>
						Alcohol myopia helps explain how alcohol can
						cause a person to feel happy one time and angry the next, and how
						good friends can end up in fights. Alcohol seems to magnify our
						emotions, and myopia helps us believe things that are not real.

                <div></br></div>
  <div id="demo5" class="collapse">
      
      <div>
                      <p>As alcohol is consumed, people often feel two different
						effects. First, alcohol produces what feels like excitement,
						increased energy, and feelings of power . This arousal is usually
						experienced at lower blood alcohol levels as drinking is started.
						In the chart below, the curve first moves up to the positive side
						of the "feeling" scale. Over time, however, the good feelings
						begin to shift down to more unpleasant, depressant effects. People
						become less aroused. These effects are usually experienced as
						being tired, being "slowed down," or feeling unsteady. Eventually
						the feelings are worse than before a person started drinking,
						because the BAC begins to drop. This is where alcohol withdrawal
						starts, and often causes headaches, feeling sick or dizzy, and
						maybe a hangover. In the chart below, this second phase is in the
						bad part of the "feeling" scale. The good feelings go up when
						first drinking, but begin to fall once you drink heavily, and
						really fall after you stop drinking. After drinking for a while,
						people usually begin to feel tired, losing that initial high. The
						higher the BAC, the lower the feelings will go: there is no
						escaping a falling BAC and the depressant second phase of the
						alcohol response. Continued drinking leads to passing out or
						unconsciousness which is an extreme form of the depressant effect.
						The only way to minimize the second phase is to drink moderate
						amounts of alcohol and not build a high BAC. Think about your own
						experiences: More alcohol is not better, and more can hurt!</p></div>
      <h3>Biphasic Response and Tolerance </h3>
      <div>
      <img src="resources/images/alcohol5.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Cinque Terre" width="90%" height="65%">
          </div>
          
      <div>
                     <p>The biphasic response to alcohol also changes with tolerance.
						Remember that tolerance refers to needing to drink more to get the
						same effect, or being able to "hold your liquor." The biphasic
						response for people with high tolerance for alcohol is different
						than for people with low tolerance. Research shows that highly
						tolerant people have a much shorter good feeling phase, that the
						good feelings aren't as strong as before, and the bad feelings
						phase tends to be longer and worse. The change in biphasic
						responses due to tolerance is shown in the chart on the previous
						page. People who have drank heavily for a long time often say they
						"no longer get the good feelings like they used to." Beside,
						increased physical tolerance can cost you (literally money),
						because it takes more alcohol to feel a buzz.
						</p><p>
						Tolerance is not necessarily good for your body either.
						Tolerance means that your
						body is physically adjusting to a toxin in your system (too much
						alcohol); but that adjustment means that your body is no longer
						warning you when you have drank too much. Tolerance takes away the
						body's stoplight that warns when enough is enough.
						</p><p>
						Many cultural
						myths have developed over time on how to get sober more quickly,
						or how to avoid hangovers the next morning. Although some of the
						ideas that have been developed are creative, remember that nothing
						can speed up the processing of alcohol by the body. The metabolic
						rate remains constant. In fact, some students who drink heavily
						the night before a morning class are likely showing up to that
						class drunk because the alcohol has not yet left their bodies.

      <div><p>Some of the methods mentioned above can actually be
						dangerous rather than helpful. Exercising when extremely
						intoxicated could risk cardiovascular complications, perhaps
						stroke or heart attack. Vomiting, as mentioned, happens after the
						alcohol has been absorbed, and some people have died from
						asphyxiation on their own vomit when intoxicated. Drinking smartly
						is a much better alternative to ineffective methods used when a
						person has already drank too much to feel good.
						</p><p>
						A Hangover is a tell-tale sign you've over-indulged. Most symptoms are brought
						about by dehydration - such as a banging headache, nausea, feeling

  <div id="demo7" class="collapse">
      <div>
      <p>Alcohol can be very dangerous when combined with some drugs.
						Alcohol can potentiate with drugs like tranquilizers, cold and
						allergy medicines, pain killers, and sleeping pills, which means
						that the effect of each is multiplied. In these cases, 1 + 1 may
						not equal 2, but 1 + 1 may equal 3 or 4. This can be quite
						dangerous. Alcohol and tranquilizers taken together, for example,
						can stop breathing and cause death. Alcohol and cold or allergy
						medicine together often cause people to get very messed up with
						very little to drink.
						</p><p>
						In other cases, alcohol can work against the
						effects of drugs, which increases tolerance for each of those
						drugs. When drinking alcohol and snorting cocaine, for example, a
						person can drink and snort a lot more than usual without noticing
						it. This is very dangerous, because too many poisons are being
						taken in, and your body cannot tell you have had too much because
						alcohol and cocaine hide the effects of each other. People have
						died using too much without even knowing it's time to stop.
						</p><p>
						Alcohol also does not get along with common medicines, such as
						cold medicine, cough syrup, antidepressant or anti-anxiety
						medication, and Ritalin. People have been to be stopped by the
						police for erratic behavior after mixing these substances with
						just a small amount of alcohol since they tend to interact with
						one another. In addition, some pain medicines can be harmful when
						taken with alcohol, such as Advil or Aleve, which can cause
						stomach bleeding, and Tylenol which can harm the liver in
						conjunction with heavy alcohol use.</p>

				      	<strong>The Four Signs</strong><br><br>
Not sure if a situation is alcohol poisoning? There are 4 signs of alcohol poisoning you should look for. To help you remember, use the acronym of C.U.P.S.<br><br>
C - COLD SKIN<br><br>
Alcohol affects parts of the brain that maintain a healthy body temperature. Too much alcohol can stop this part of the brain from working and can cause your organs to shut down. People with alcohol poisoning can be cold to the touch.<br><br>
U - UNRESPONSIVE<br><br>
When a person has consumed so much alcohol that they can’t function normally they may not be able to respond to anything. It's like alcohol anesthesia.<br><br>
P - PUKING<br><br>
Alcohol poisoning causes people to puke. Puking won't lower a person's BAC, but it can make a person even more dehydrated. Alcohol also inhibits a person's gag reflex. This might make a person choke on their own vomit or breathe it into their lungs.<br><br>
S - SLOW BREATHING<br><br>
Alcohol also affects the part of the brain that regulates breathing. Breaths can become slow, shallow and irregular. A person may even have fewer than 8 breaths per minute. If a person isn't breathing enough, they aren't getting enough oxygen to their brain.<br><br>

						<div class="panel-body">
							<p>A hangover is a tell-tale sign you’ve over-indulged. Most
								symptoms are brought about by dehydration – such as a banging
								headache, nausea, feeling tired and sluggish. The best thing you
								can do is to drink plenty of water, eat a potassium rich snack
								like a banana and go for a stroll to get some fresh air. Alcohol
								is packed with calories that contain no nutritional value. A
								large glass of red wine contains almost as much as a slice of
								cake! A 5% pint of lager is 240-250 calories – that’s the
								equivalent of a burger! At 7 calories a gram that’s almost as
								much as pure fat!
								</p>
								<p> Mood: When we drink low or moderate amounts of
								alcohol, it tends to amplify our emotions. So if we’re happy, we
								can feel better – but if we’re not so happy we tend to feel
								worse. Drinking alcohol can lead to and be a symptom of poor
								mental health such as anxiety and depression.
								</p><p>
								 Anxiety: Did you
								know alcohol uses up natural chemicals in the brain? These
								chemicals are vital to reducing anxiety and lifting mood. So it
								can be easy to become trapped in a cycle of drinking to make
								yourself feel better, without realizing you’re probably just
								making the problem worse.
								</p><p>
								Skin: Alcohol dehydrates the skin
								and depletes it of essential nutrients, making your skin appear
								dull and tired. Drinking alcohol also dilates the facial blood
								vessels, making you more susceptible to spidery red thread
								veins. Pre-existing skin conditions like Psoriasis and Rosacea
								are both made worse by alcohol. 
								</p><p>
								Nails: Strong, healthy nails rely
								on a balanced intake of nutrients and plenty of water. Brittle
								nails could be one sign you’re drinking more than you think.
								</p><p>
								Hair: Your hair also relies on your body being hydrated. Regular
								drinking can leave you with dry and brittle hair. Excessive
								drinking depletes iron and can cause hair loss.
								</p><p>
								Sleep: A few too
								many drinks before bedtime and you might think you’re getting
								off to sleep quickly, but an excess of alcohol means you can go
								straight into deep sleep missing out the usual first stage of
								rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Instead of having typically 6-7
								cycles of REM sleep, you’ll only have 1-2, meaning you’ll wake up
								feeling tired.
								</p><p>
								Up in the night: When you’ve been drinking
								you’re more likely to get up in the middle of the night to go to
								the toilet too. Drinking also causes heartburn and because it
								relaxes the muscles in your body including the throat, it
								increases your likelihood of snoring. For a great night’s sleep,
								make that nightcap a glass of water.
								</p><p>
								Feeling Stressed: It can be
								all too easy to let alcohol become a habit when trying to unwind
								after another hard day. But it isn’t a good idea. Drinking
								alcohol stops us from sleeping properly and together with a
								hangover can make life more difficult all round. All of which
								just leads to more stress.
								</p><p>
								 Memory: Alcohol can do more than leave
								you struggling to remember the events of the night before. Over
								time, heavy drinking can lead to memory loss problems – in
								particular, a Vitamin B1 deficiency causes Wernicke-Korsakoff's
								Syndrome – a dementia-like illness.</p>

							<p>Having a night out? Make sure you stay safe. Remember that
								alcohol can put you at greater risk of crime. And that it can
								impair your judgment which can make you misinterpret people and
								even respond inappropriately if you think you're being provoked.
								By looking out for friends and taking a few simple precautions,
								you can make sure your big night is memorable for all the right
								reasons.
								</p>
								<p>
								 Assault: 70% of assaults at Emergency Departments were
								likely to have been alcohol-related.Alcohol can make us more
								aggressive which is why fights often start after we’ve been
								drinking. It reduces our ability to think straight. You’re less
								likely to misinterpret someone’s behavior or social cues if you
								haven’t been drinking. If you’re being provoked by someone who
								has been drinking, the best advice is to walk away.
								</p><p>
								 House fires:
								When you’ve had a few drinks, it’s all too easy to leave the
								stove on, or not stub out a cigarette properly. A recent report
								indicated that alcohol was a contributory factor in almost 3 in
								10 fatal house fires. 
								</p><p>
								Hypothermia: Although it makes us feel
								warmer, alcohol lowers core body temperature. People who fall
								asleep outside after drinking alcohol are at risk of hypothermia
								and even death. Even if you’re still awake, if it’s a cold night
								and you’re not dressed for the weather, there’s still a risk of
								hypothermia. 
								</p><p>
								Getting home safely: Finding a taxi can be difficult
								late at night, so you might want to book one in advance. And
								make sure you keep some money back so you can pay for it. If
								you're walking, walk with someone you know and trust. If you
								have to walk alone, stick to well-lit and well-used routes and
								keep your mobile handy. Let someone know what you're doing if
								you can and call them when you get home.</p>

							<p>Every drink we have adds up, and over time it can have a
								bigger impact on our health and well-being than we realize.
								That's why it's important to stick to the sensible drinking
								guidelines. 
								</p><p>
								Women shouldn't regularly drink more than 2-3 units
								(equivalent to a 175ml glass of 13% wine) of alcohol a day, and
								men 3-4 units (equivalent to a pint and a half of 4% lager). We
								should all try to take at least two alcohol-free days a week to
								give our body a break. 
								</p><p>
								Women can drink just as much as men if
								they want. Not true. With smaller bodies (including smaller
								livers) and a different physical make-up, alcohol affects women
								differently – which is why the sensible drinking guidelines for
								women are lower.
								</p><p>
								You don't have to be knocking back several
								pints every night in the pub for alcohol to damage your health.
								The truth is, over half of us do our drinking at home nowadays.
								Those generous home measures can mean you're regularly drinking
								over the sensible drinking guidelines without even realizing it.
								Here are just some of the ways alcohol can affect your overall
								health and well-being.
								</p><p>
								Over time, regularly drinking more than
								the sensible drinking guidelines will affect your appearance and
								general health. But it can also disrupt your sleep and lead to
								an increased risk of high blood pressure, cause chronic liver
								disease to develop, and even increase your risk of breast
								cancer.</p>

							<p>Most of us enjoy a drink now and then, at home or when we
								get together with friends. But are you drinking more than you
								think? 28% of men drink 3 or more times a week. Men drink more
								on average than women and unsurprisingly as a result, men suffer
								more ill effects. 
								</p><p>
								A beer belly is one of the most obvious
								results of drinking too much, but it’s more than just a turn-off
								– having a beer belly can increase your risk of cardiovascular
								disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea and cancer.
								</p><p>
								Fertility: For both men and women, too much alcohol lowers your
								fertility. As few as five drinks a week reduces a woman's chance

							<p>At 7 calories per gram, alcohol has more calories than
								many foods. Cutting back on the amount you drink is a great way
								to detox and reduce the amount of calories you're consuming.
								</p><p>
								For many of us, drinking sensibly is key to controlling our weight.
								After all, at 7 calories per gram, alcohol has nearly as many
								calories as pure fat! As you might know, there are almost 200
								calories in just one large glass of wine! That’s nearly as many
								as a four chocolate covered cookies or packet of potato chips! Two
								beers – at nearly 300 calories that’s almost as many as a
								lunch time sandwich. 
								</p><p>
								Increasing your appetite: Alcohol both
								stimulates our appetite and reduces our self-control, making it
								far too easy to eat too much. This explains why you reach for
								another packet of potato chips when you’re having a drink at home and
								crave high fat, salty junk food at the end of a night out.
								</p><p>
								Empty calories: Calories from alcohol are ‘empty’ calories. They
								have no nutritional value. If you have a drink while cooking or
								watching the TV before dinner you could have consumed around 250
								calories before you even tuck in! 
								</p><p>
								Extra pounds: Drinking alcohol
								reduces the amount of fat your body burns for energy. While our
								bodies store nutrients, protein and carbohydrates, it can’t store
								alcohol and so our systems want to get rid of it first. As a
								result, the calories in alcohol are metabolized by our bodies
								ahead of burning fat or absorbing nutrients – bad news for your
								waistline. 
								</p><p>
								Think about what you drink: By taking simple steps to
								drink responsibly such as opting for a small rather than a large
								glass of wine, measuring your drinks at home using a measuring
								cup, or keeping a drinks diary, you can start to make a
								difference to your waistline and your health.</p>

						<div class="panel-heading">I. The Visible Effects</div>
						<div class="panel-body">
							<p>A hangover is a tell-tale sign you’ve over-indulged. Most
								symptoms are brought about by dehydration – such as a banging
								headache, nausea, feeling tired and sluggish. The best thing you
								can do is to drink plenty of water, eat a potassium rich snack
								like a banana and go for a stroll to get some fresh air 
								</p><p>
								Alcohol is packed with calories that contain no nutritional value. A
								large glass of red wine contains almost as much as a slice of
								cake! A 5% pint of lager is 240-250 calories – that’s the
								equivalent of a burger! At 7 calories a gram that’s almost as
								much as pure fat! 
								</p><p>
								Mood: When we drink low or moderate amounts of
								alcohol, it tends to amplify our emotions. So if we’re happy, we
								can feel better – but if we’re not so happy we tend to feel
								worse. Drinking alcohol can lead to and be a symptom of poor
								mental health such as anxiety and depression.
								</p><p>
								Anxiety: Did you
								know alcohol uses up natural chemicals in the brain? These
								chemicals are vital to reducing anxiety and lifting mood. So it
								can be easy to become trapped in a cycle of drinking to make
								yourself feel better, without realizing you’re probably just
								making the problem worse. 
								</p><p>
								Skin: Alcohol dehydrates the skin
								and depletes it of essential nutrients, making your skin appear
								dull and tired. Drinking alcohol also dilates the facial blood
								vessels, making you more susceptible to spidery red thread
								veins. Pre-existing skin conditions like Psoriasis and Rosacea
								are both made worse by alcohol. 
								</p><p>
								Nails: Strong, healthy nails rely
								on a balanced intake of nutrients and plenty of water. Brittle
								nails could be one sign you’re drinking more than you think.
								</p><p>
								Hair: Your hair also relies on your body being hydrated. Regular
								drinking can leave you with dry and brittle hair. Excessive
								drinking depletes iron and can cause hair loss.
								</p><p>
								Sleep: A few too
								many drinks before bedtime and you might think you’re getting
								off to sleep quickly, but an excess of alcohol means you can go
								straight into deep sleep missing out the usual first stage of
								rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Instead of having typically 6-7
								cycles of REM sleep, you’ll only have 1-2, meaning you’ll wake up
								feeling tired.
								</p><p>
								Up in the night: When you’ve been drinking
								you’re more likely to get up in the middle of the night to go to
								the toilet too. Drinking also causes heartburn and because it
								relaxes the muscles in your body including the throat, it
								increases your likelihood of snoring. For a great night’s sleep,
								make that nightcap a glass of water. 
								</p><p>
								Feeling Stressed: It can be
								all too easy to let alcohol become a habit when trying to unwind
								after another hard day. But it isn’t a good idea. Drinking
								alcohol stops us from sleeping properly and together with a
								hangover can make life more difficult all round. All of which
								just leads to more stress.
								</p><p>
								Memory: Alcohol can do more than leave
								you struggling to remember the events of the night before. Over
								time, heavy drinking can lead to memory loss problems – in
								particular, a Vitamin B1 deficiency causes Wernicke-Korsakoff's
								Syndrome – a dementia-like illness.</p>

							<p>Having a night out? Make sure you stay safe. Remember that
								alcohol can put you at greater risk of crime. And that it can
								impair your judgment which can make you misinterpret people and
								even respond inappropriately if you think you're being provoked.
								By looking out for friends and taking a few simple precautions,
								you can make sure your big night is memorable for all the right
								reasons.
								</p><p>
								Assault: 70% of assaults at Emergency Departments were
								likely to have been alcohol-related.Alcohol can make us more
								aggressive which is why fights often start after we've been
								drinking. It reduces our ability to think straight. you're less
								likely to misinterpret someone's behavior or social cues if you
								haven't been drinking. If you're being provoked by someone who
								has been drinking, the best advice is to walk away.
								</p><p>
								House fires:
								When you've had a few drinks, it's all too easy to leave the
								stove on, or not stub out a cigarette properly. A recent report
								indicated that alcohol was a contributory factor in almost 3 in
								10 fatal house fires.
								</p><p>
								Hypothermia: Although it makes us feel
								warmer, alcohol lowers core body temperature. People who fall
								asleep outside after drinking alcohol are at risk of hypothermia
								and even death. Even if you're still awake, if it's a cold night
								and you're not dressed for the weather, there's still a risk of
								hypothermia.
								</p><p>
								Getting home safely: Finding a taxi can be difficult
								late at night, so you might want to book one in advance. And
								make sure you keep some money back so you can pay for it. If
								you're walking, walk with someone you know and trust. If you
								have to walk alone, stick to well-lit and well-used routes and
								keep your mobile handy. Let someone know what you're doing if
								you can and call them when you get home.</p>

						<div class="panel-body">
							<p>Every drink we have adds up, and over time it can have a
								bigger impact on our health and well-being than we realize.
								That's why it's important to stick to the sensible drinking
								guidelines. Women shouldn't regularly drink more than 2-3 units
								(equivalent to a 175ml glass of 13% wine) of alcohol a day, and
								men 3-4 units (equivalent to a pint and a half of 4% lager). We
								should all try to take at least two alcohol-free days a week to
								give our body a break.
								</p><p>
								Women can drink just as much as men if
								they want. Not true. With smaller bodies (including smaller
								livers) and a different physical make-up, alcohol affects women
								differently - which is why the sensible drinking guidelines
								for women are lower.
								</p><p>
								You don't have to be knocking back
								several pints every night in the pub for alcohol to damage your
								health. The truth is, over half of us do our drinking at home
								nowadays. Those generous home measures can mean you're regularly
								drinking over the sensible drinking guidelines without even
								realizing it. Here are just some of the ways alcohol can affect
								your overall health and well-being.
								</p><p>
								Over time, regularly drinking
								more than the sensible drinking guidelines will affect your
								appearance and general health. But it can also disrupt your
								sleep and lead to an increased risk of high blood pressure,
								cause chronic liver disease to develop, and even increase your
								risk of breast cancer.</p>

							<p>Women's bodies react to alcohol in a different way to
								men's. Women have on average 10% more fat than men, which mean
								there's less body fluid to dilute alcohol, so it travels around
								Women's bodies in more concentrated form and causes more harm.
								</p><p>
								Women's livers produce less of the substance the body uses to
								break alcohol down (an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase).
								This means not only do women get drunk quicker but the effects
								last longer too.
								</p><p>
								Alcohol dehydrates the skin and depletes it of
								essential nutrients, making your skin appear dull and tired and
								your hair and nails brittle. Drinking alcohol also dilates the
								facial blood vessels, making you more susceptible to spidery red
								thread veins. Pre-existing skin conditions like Psoriasis and
								Rosacea are both made worse by alcohol.
								</p><p>
								Just one large glass of
								red wine contains around 200 calories - almost the same as
								four chocolate cookies or a packet of potato chips! At 7
								calories a gram, alcohol contains more calories than many foods
								- bad news for your waistline. Alcohol also stimulates our
								appetite, but reduces our self-control, so you're more likely to
								give in to unhealthy snacks or late night suppers.
								</p><p>
								Alcohol
								reduces the amount of fat your body burns for energy. The
								calories in alcohol are metabolized by the body first before it
								burns fat or absorbs nutrients, making us less likely to absorb
								essential vitamins and more prone to gain weight. Sticking to
								the sensible drinking guidelines can help you maintain a healthy
								weight.
								</p><p>
								The risk of breast cancer increases from drinking as
								little as 1-2 units a day (that's one small (125ml) glass of
								12% wine) In Scotland alone, 500 new cases of breast cancer each
								year could be linked to alcohol consumption. A recent study has
								shown that the risk of breast cancer increases by 7-11% for
								every unit drunk. 
								</p><p>
								The chronic liver disease rate amongst 30-44
								year old women in Scotland has tripled since the mid to late
								1980s. it's important to remember that you Don't have to have a
								hangover to be doing damage to your liver. 
								</p><p>
								Alcohol lowers sperm
								count in men and fertility in women. A recent study by the
								British Medical Journal suggested that as few as five or less
								drinks every week would decrease a woman's chance of becoming
								pregnant. The best advice is, if you want to conceive, avoid
								alcohol completely. 
								</p><p>
								A few days before a period, and during
								ovulation, you'll feel the effects of alcohol more quickly. But
								beware, the pill has the opposite effect, it delays the
								absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream and the time it takes
								to leave your body so you won't be as aware of the effects and
								might drink more than you realize.
								</p><p>
								It's likely to take a woman
								longer than a man to recover from the damage caused by a big
								night. Taking two days off alcohol every week is a great way to
								give your body a break, particularly after an indulgent night
								</p><p>
								There is evidence that even drinking one or two units a day can
								lead to health and development problems for baby. Any alcohol
								you drink while pregnant will reach your baby via the placenta
								and may cause harm.
								</p><p>
								The simple fact is alcohol and pregnancy
								just don't mix. When you're pregnant, the health of your unborn
								baby will obviously be the most important consideration - and
								drinking while pregnant could result in birth defects
								</p><p>
								Even small
								quantities of alcohol can cause Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and
								Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). FAS and FASD can cause
								life-long learning and behavioral problems, so the choices you
								make now can have life-long effects on your child.

			<div id="cues" class="collapse">
					<div>
						<p>
							Factors which have been shown to increase the chances of
							overdrinking are called cues. Cues of overdrinking are not direct
							causes for overdrinking or alcohol problems, but they increase
							the probability of drinking. These factors are usually present in
							situations in which it is easy to drink too much. If you can
							identify your cues then you'll have early warnings for the
							possibility that you may be at risk to drink too much in a given
							situation, which gives you a chance to make some decisions and
							perhaps make some changes. Here are some general “cue”
							categories:<br>
							<br> 1. <u>The people you are with.</u> Being around heavy drinkers
							will increase the drinking rate of those around them. Think about
							the times when you over drink. Who are the people with you? What
							are they doing? <br>
							<br> 2. <u>The place where you are drinking.</u> Research also
							shows that people tend to drink more and faster in certain
							places. Likewise, there are settings where you tend to drink
							less. Do you notice drinking differences across different places?<br>
							<br> 3. <u>The time and day.</u> People are more likely to over
							drink on certain days or at certain times--time off from work,
							happy hour, after finals, weddings, birthdays, etc. Have you
							noticed any specific hours or days on which you tend to over
							drink?<br>
							<br> 4. <u>Hunger and thirst.</u> Some people find that they drink
							more when they are hungry or thirsty, or both. Is this true for
							you? Ironically, alcohol does not satisfy real thirst. It
							actually dehydrates your body; you lose bodily fluids when
							alcohol is consumed. Alcohol does not satisfy real thirst.<br>
							<br> 5. <u>Special situational factors.</u> Some people report
							different situations in which they drink without thinking, like
							when they have a lot of money or alcohol available, or when
							bored, or doing things like playing pool or cards, or video
							games.<br>
							<br> 6. <u>Emotional factors.</u> These include depression,
							boredom, frustration, anger, conflict, and tension; also joy,
							relaxation, or excitement. Again, we are not saying that emotions
							"cause" overdrinking, but some people over drink when they feel a
							certain way; for example, feeling frustrated. If you become aware
							of overdrinking when you feel frustrated, this awareness will
							provide a cue or signal to stop and think <u>before</u> overdrinking.<br>
