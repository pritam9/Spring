				  <div id="demo11" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				          <p>The following sanctions or combination of sanctions may be imposed by the Office of Student Conduct upon any individual student or student organization found “Responsible” for violations of the Code of Student Responsibility. Conduct sanctions are implemented to educate and inform students on the behavior that led to the violation. It is the intent of the Office of Student Conduct to educate students on their behavior in regards to the Code of Student Conduct so they are better able to make informed decisions. In light of the facts and circumstances of each case, a Conduct hold may be placed by the Dean of Student Office on Registration (if not already in place) upon receiving sanctions or failure to comply with the imposed sanctions. A student found responsible for a violation of the Code of Student Conduct shall be subject to sanctions commensurate with the offense with consideration given to any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, including but not limited to the student’s conduct record. Potential sanctions are outlined below:</p><br>
				          <p><strong>Individual Sanctions</strong></p>
				          <ul>
				          	<li>Conduct Reprimand -Formal notice from the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct or a designee indicating that further misconduct may result in a more severe student conduct action. A copy of the reprimand becomes a part of the student's conduct file.</li>
				          	<li>Conduct Probation - A status in which a student is deemed not to be in good conduct standing with the University for a definite period of duration not less than the remainder of the semester. In the event a student on conduct probation is found responsible for a violation of any University rule or regulation, suspension or expulsion from the University could result. Conditions restricting a student's participation in campus activities may be imposed. The probationary status becomes part of the student's conduct file.</li>
				          	<li>Indefinite Conduct Probation - A status in which a student is deemed not to be in good conduct standing with the University for an indefinite period of duration. In the event a student on conduct probation is found responsible for a violation of any University rule or regulation, suspension or expulsion from the University could result. Conditions restricting a student's participation in campus activities may be imposed. Indefinite probation remains in effect until the student successfully petitions the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct for reinstatement to good standing. The probationary status becomes part of the student's conduct file.</li>
				          	<li>Removal or Deferred Removal from University Housing – Loss of the privilege of living in campus housing. Removal may be for a fixed period of time (but not less than the remainder of the semester), or for an indefinite period. If the removal is for an indefinite period, the student may petition the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct or a designee for restoration of the right not sooner than one calendar year after the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct has approved the removal. Any sanction including removal from University housing includes a trespass order from student housing for the duration of the sanction.</li>
				          	<li>Suspension – Separation of the student from the University for a fixed period of not less than the remainder of the semester in which the suspension is imposed. A sanction of definite suspension automatically includes a trespass order from University property, including student housing, for the duration of the suspension. Violation of the terms of a definite suspension may subject the student to additional sanctions pursuant to Sections IX(e) and (q) above. Suspension for violation of Section IX(v) above may include suspension of access to University computing and electronic communication resources. Notification of the suspension will appear on the student's academic transcript and will remain until the end of the suspension period. In order to re-enroll at the University at the conclusion of the suspension term, the student must reapply for admission to the University, but no student may be readmitted to the University until after the suspension period has ended.</li>
							<li>Indefinite Suspension –Separation of the student from the University for a minimum of one calendar year after the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct has approved the suspension and thereafter until the student successfully petitions the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct in writing for reinstatement to good standing. A sanction of indefinite suspension automatically includes a trespass order from University property, including student housing, for the duration of the suspension. Violation of the terms of an indefinite suspension may subject the student to additional sanctions pursuant to Sections IX (e) and (g) above. Notification of the conduct suspension will appear on the student's academic transcript until the date the student is reinstated to good standing. If the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct grants reinstatement, the student may reapply for admission to the University, but no student may be readmitted to the University until after the Senior Associate Dean and Director of Student Conduct has granted reinstatement.</li>
							<li>Expulsion – Expulsion is a permanent separation of the student from the University. Expulsion for violation of Section IX (v) above includes removal of access to University computing and electronic communication resources. Violation of the terms of expulsion may subject the student to arrest. The student may petition the Chancellor in writing for the expulsion to be rescinded, but not earlier than two years after the date on which the expulsion takes effect. A student who has been expelled from one constituent institution of The University of North Carolina system may not be admitted to another UNC System institution until the sanction of expulsion has been rescinded by the institution that imposed the sanction. Notification will appear on the student's academic transcript. The student will be given a notice of trespass with respect to University premises.</li>
							<li>Post-Enrollment and Post-Graduation Sanctions – A student who commits a violation of the Code or is found responsible for violating the Code, but who graduates from UNC Charlotte before imposition of a sanction, is subject to (1) revocation of any degree awarded, (2) temporary or permanent withholding of the transcript for any degree earned, regardless of whether the degree has been awarded, and/or (3) having sanction(s) imposed as a condition of re-enrollment at the University.</li>
							<li>Suspension – Mandatory separation from the University. During the period of suspension the student is barred from the UNC Charlotte campus.

				      	<strong>Executive Summary:</strong><br><br> 
This Policy governs the possession and consumption of Alcoholic Beverages on Campus. <br><br>
<strong>I. Introduction</strong><br><br>
The laws of North Carolina closely regulate all activities related to Alcoholic Beverages, from manufacture to consumption. As a general rule, consumption, transportation, manufacture, service, Sale, or transfer of Alcoholic Beverages is prohibited except as expressly permitted by statute. Violations of the Alcoholic Beverage laws are punishable by criminal and civil penalties. Of particular importance in the University community are those statutory requirements on who may legally possess, consume or provide others with Alcoholic Beverages. All state-law requirements related to Alcoholic Beverages are in effect on the University Campus. All students, staff, faculty, and guests are expected to comply.<br>
In addition to statutory requirements concerning alcohol use, courts throughout the country are increasingly likely to impose civil liability on those whose irresponsible service or consumption of Alcoholic Beverages results in property damage, personal injury, or death for innocent parties. All students, staff, faculty, and guests are viewed by the University as individually responsible and legally accountable for their actions relating to the use of alcohol.<br>
Finally, the University community presents a special context in which an environment compatible with academic endeavors must be preserved. To preserve that academic environment without unnecessarily restricting exercise of legal privileges, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte has established this policy concerning the use of Alcoholic Beverages on the University Campus.<br><br>
<strong>II. Definitions</strong><br><br>
As used in this policy, certain terms are defined as follows:<br>
<strong>Affiliated Group; Non-Affiliated Group; Sponsored Non-Affiliated Group:</strong> The definitions for "Affiliated Group," "Non-Affiliated Group," and "Sponsored Non-Affiliated Group" set forth in University Policy 601.6, "Scheduling University Facilities," also apply to this Policy.<br>  
<strong>Alcoholic Beverage:</strong> Any beverage containing at least one half of one percent (0.5%) of alcohol by volume.<br>
<strong>Approving Authority:</strong><br>
(a)   For the Harris Alumni Center - the Vice Chancellor for University Advancement, or designee;<br>
(b)   For the Center City Building - the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, or designee;<br>
(c)   For residence areas - the Housing and Residence Life Office;<br>
(d)   For all other areas of Campus - the Conference, Reservations and Events Services Office.<br>
<strong>Beer:</strong> Malt beverages, including Beer, liquor, malt liquor, ale, porter, and any other brewed or fermented beverage except Unfortified Wine or Fortified Wine containing at least one half of one percent (0.5%), and not more than fifteen percent (15%) alcohol by volume. Any malt beverage containing more than six percent (6%) alcohol by volume shall bear a label clearly indicating the alcohol content of the malt beverage.<br>
<strong>BYO or Bring Your Own Event:</strong> An event, other than Tailgating, at which an invitee may carry in Beer or Unfortified Wine for personal consumption; no other Alcoholic Beverage is available at the event.<br>
<strong>Campus:</strong> All property owned or leased by UNC Charlotte, with the exception of the Chancellor’s residence.<br>
<strong>Common Source Containers:</strong> Kegs, coolers, and similar containers of Alcoholic Beverages intended to serve as a source of such beverages at a party or other gathering.<br>
<strong>Fortified Wine:</strong> Any wine, of more than sixteen percent (16%) and no more than twenty four percent (24%) alcohol by volume, made by fermentation from grapes, fruits, berries, rice or honey, or by the addition of pure cane, beet, or dextrose sugar; or by the addition of pure brandy from the same type of grape, fruit, berry, rice, or honey that is contained in the base wine and produced in accordance with the regulations of the United States.<br>
<strong>Group Event:</strong> A Service Event sponsored by an Affiliated Group; Non-Affiliated Group; or Sponsored Non-Affiliated Group.<br>
<strong>Mixed Beverage:</strong> A drink composed in whole or in part of Spirituous Liquor and served in a quantity less than the quantity contained in a closed package or a premixed cocktail served from a closed package containing only one serving.<br>
Sale of Alcoholic Beverages means any transfer, trade, exchange, or barter, in any manner or by any means, for consideration. Sale is broadly interpreted by law enforcement authorities to include such practices as charging admission to events where alcohol is served, requiring the purchase of tickets, or requiring donations or other exchanges in order to receive Alcoholic Beverages. Such exchanges are viewed as indirect payment for Alcoholic Beverages and are, therefore, illegal. However, as a limited exception to this general rule, the service of Alcoholic Beverages at a ticketed fundraising event sponsored by the University or a non-profit organization that is an Affiliated Group, Non-Affiliated Group, or Sponsored Non-Affiliated Group shall not be construed as a sale, provided (a) there is no separate charge for the Alcoholic Beverage that is served (b) no State funds are used to purchase the alcohol, and (c) the non-profit organization or the University obtains the appropriate permit from the ABC Commission for the service of Alcoholic Beverages at the event. (N.C.G.S. 18B 1002(a)(5))<br>
<strong>Service Event:</strong> A Service Event is an event sponsored by the University or an Affiliated Group, Non-Affiliated Group, or Sponsored Non-Affiliated Group at which Alcoholic Beverages are served to invitees.<br>
<strong>Spirituous Liquor:</strong> Distilled spirits or ethyl alcohol, including spirits of wine, whiskey, rum, brandy, gin and all other distilled spirits and mixtures of cordials, liqueur, and premixed cocktails, in closed containers for beverage use regardless of their dilution.<br>
<strong>Tailgating:</strong> Parking, gathering and/or consuming food and beverages, including Alcoholic Beverages, at an approved, designated Tailgating area during the approved times before or after official UNC Charlotte inter-collegiate athletic events on the University Campus. See Tailgating Policy, Appendix III.<br>
<strong>Unfortified Wine:</strong> Wine any wine of sixteen percent (16%) or less alcohol by volume made by fermentation from grapes, fruits, berries, rice, or honey; or by the addition of pure cane, beet, or dextrose sugar; or by the addition of pure brandy from the same type of grape, fruit, berry, rice, or honey that is contained in the base wine and produced in accordance with the regulations of the United States.<br><br>
<strong>III. Applicable Laws</strong><br><br>

                <div></br></div>
				  <div id="alcVioRape" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				      	<p>
				      	Alcohol seems to go together with violence. Alcohol is involved in over 50% of violent and aggressive acts, including fighting, breaking things, rape, swearing and acting verbally abusive toward another individual. Men, in particular, are more likely to act aggressively while intoxicated.<br><br> 

Another explanation for the relationship between alcohol and aggression has to do with expectations about alcohol effects. Remember, men are more likely to behave aggressively if they think they have consumed alcohol. This might be particularly true of very angry people who use alcohol as an "excuse" for violent behavior.<br><br>

Alcohol use is commonly involved in rape. In a recent survey of 6,100 undergraduate women and men at 32 colleges across the United States, one in four women were victims of rape or attempted rape, usually while on a date. Within this alarming number of reported incidences, about 75% of the men and at least 55% of the women had been drinking or taking drugs just before the attack. Use of alcohol by women particularly while partying or at the early stages of a new relationship can be quite risky. Research has shown that women drinking alcohol or who are intoxicated are typically perceived by men as more sexual and interested in engaging in sex, regardless of how the woman herself feels at that particular moment. Being drunk also makes it difficult for women to act effectively to defend themselves. Knowing that this is the case, some men purposely attempt to get a woman drunk to increase her vulnerability.<br><br> 

Women who are raped while intoxicated also face special problems, typically in understanding or healing from the trauma of rape. It is quite common for women raped while intoxicated to not recall the attack rape, despite their feeling that something was wrong. Women often have difficulty understanding why they feel depressed and seldom seek services from a rape crisis center. Unfortunately, people are less likely to think of it as rape if she was drinking at the time.<br><br> 

Fortunately, there are things that both men and women can do to reduce their risks of a rape. We suggest the following: <br>

•	Women should get to know their date in "safe" settings where you are able to leave freely and on your terms when you need to, or where there are others around.<br> 

•	Both men and women should be aware that alcohol use places women at risk for being perceived as sexual. Women can choose to avoid this perception, and men should know that drinking alcohol does not communicate a desire for sex.<br>
 
•	Remember that alcohol doesn't improve sex. Having sex without mutual consent hurts people, builds distrust, and damages relationships.<br> 

•	Look after your friends. Stop men who plan to or are engaging in aggressive sexual behavior, and protect friends who are vulnerable. Women who think they might become drunk at a party or bar can make a safety plan well in advance of the party. Have a friend who plans to not drink serve as your "buddy".<br> 

For women who have been raped, we encourage you to seek support from a local rape crisis center. Most major cities have hotlines and other services for women and are usually listed in telephone directories.<br>

				  <div id="cueOverDrinking" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				      	<p>
				      	Factors which have been shown to increase the chances of overdrinking are called cues. Cues of overdrinking are not direct causes for overdrinking or alcohol problems, but they increase the probability of drinking. These factors are usually present in situations in which it is easy to drink too much. If you can identify your cues then you'll have early warnings for the possibility that you may be at risk to drink too much in a given situation, which gives you a chance to make some decisions and perhaps make some changes. Here are some general “cue” categories:<br><br> 

1.	The people you are with. Being around heavy drinkers will increase the drinking rate of those around them. Think about the times when you over drink. Who are the people with you? What are they doing? <br><br>

2.	The place where you are drinking. Research also shows that people tend to drink more and faster in certain places.  Likewise, there are settings where you tend to drink less. Do you notice drinking differences across different places?<br><br> 

3.	The time and day. People are more likely to over drink on certain days or at certain times--time off from work, happy hour, after finals, weddings, birthdays, etc. Have you noticed any specific hours or days on which you tend to over drink?<br><br> 

4.	Hunger and thirst. Some people find that they drink more when they are hungry or thirsty, or both. Is this true for you? Ironically, alcohol does not satisfy real thirst. It actually dehydrates your body; you lose bodily fluids when alcohol is consumed. Alcohol does not satisfy real thirst.<br><br> 

5.	Special situational factors. Some people report different situations in which they drink without thinking, like when they have a lot of money or alcohol available, or when bored, or doing things like playing pool or cards, or video games.<br><br> 

6.	Emotional factors. These include depression, boredom, frustration, anger, conflict, and tension; also joy, relaxation, or excitement. Again, we are not saying that emotions "cause" overdrinking, but some people over drink when they feel a certain way; for example, feeling frustrated. If you become aware of overdrinking when you feel frustrated, this awareness will provide a cue or signal to stop and think before overdrinking.<br><br>
