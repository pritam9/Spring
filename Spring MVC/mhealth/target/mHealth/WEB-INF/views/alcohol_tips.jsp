				      	  <p>Most sexual assaults on a college campus are non-stranger assaults, meaning that the individuals involved knew each other. Alcohol is a factor in many of these non-stranger sexual assaults as every year more than 70,000 college students ages 18-24 are victims of sexual assault in which alcohol use was involved.</p><br>
				          <p>In some cases people drink in the context of wanting to “hook-up” with someone. In cases such as these individuals who have been drinking may be more likely to act on a belief that it is okay to engage in sexual activity without getting the other person’s consent or their alcohol use may make it feel easier for them to ignore the need to get consent. Drinking may also reduce an individual’s ability to process and react to the other person’s behavioral cues indicating that they do not want to engage in sexual activity. Intoxication is not an excuse for sexual assault and an intoxicated person can be held responsible for their actions.</p><br>
				          <p>Some people who have committed sexual assault might have encouraged their victims to drink large amounts of alcohol or might have intentionally sought out those who were already drunk. Every year more than 100,000 students report having been too intoxicated to know if they consented to having sex. Remember, <strong>a person who is intoxicated cannot legally provide consent for sexual activity.</strong></p><br>

				      	  Alcohol is the most commonly used addictive substance in the United States: 17.6 million people, or one in every 12 adults, suffer from alcohol abuse or dependence along with several million more who engage in risky, binge drinking patterns that could lead to alcohol problems.<br><br>
More than half of all adults have a family history of alcoholism or problem drinking, and more than 7 million children live in a household where at least one parent is dependent on or has abused alcohol.<br><br>
Alcohol abuse and alcoholism can affect all aspects of a person's life.  Long-term alcohol use can cause serious health complications, can damage emotional stability, finances, career, and impact one's family, friends and community.<br><br>

<strong>Facts About Alcohol:</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>88,000 deaths are annually attributed to excessive alcohol use</li>
			<li>Alcoholism is the 3rd leading lifestyle-related cause of death in the nation</li>
			<li>Excessive alcohol use is responsible for 2.5 million years of potential life lost annually, or an average of about 30 years of potential life lost for each death</li>
			<li>Up to 40% of all hospital beds in the United States (except for those being used by maternity and intensive care patients) are being used to treat health conditions that are related to alcohol consumption</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
<strong>Over time, excessive alcohol use, both in the form of heavy drinking or binge drinking, can lead to numerous health problems, chronic diseases, neurological impairments and social problems, including but not limited to:</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Dementia, stroke and neuropathy</li>
			<li>Cardiovascular problems, including myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and hypertension</li>
			<li>Psychiatric problems, including depression, anxiety, and suicide</li>
			<li>Social problems, including unemployment, lost productivity, family problems, violence including child maltreatment, fights and homicide</li>
			<li>Unintentional injuries, such as motor-vehicle traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns and firearm injuries.</li>
			<li>Increased risk for many kinds of cancers, including liver, mouth, throat, larynx (voice box) and esophagus</li>
			<li>Liver diseases, including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis</li>
			<li>Gastrointestinal problems, including pancreatitis and gastritis</li>
			<li>Alcohol abuse or dependence – alcoholism.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
<p>Alcoholism has little to do with what kind of alcohol one drinks, how long one has been drinking, or even exactly how much alcohol one consumes.  But it has a great deal to do with a person's uncontrollable need for alcohol.  Most alcoholics can't just "use a little willpower" to stop drinking.  The alcoholic is frequently in the grip of a powerful craving for alcohol, a need that can feel as strong as the need for food or water.  While some people are able to recover without help, the majority of alcoholics need outside assistance to recover from their disease.  Yet, with support and treatment, many are able to stop drinking and reclaim their lives.<br></p>

  <div class="panel-body">
   <p>
   1.	A large glass of wine can contain over 1.5 standard drinks of alcohol. Think about how that adds up over a night if you’re drinking more than one, and perhaps go for a smaller glass for a change.<br><br>

2.	Think about how much you’re going to drink before you go on a night out. One way of making sure you don’t go over this is to take only enough money to buy the drinks you want (and a bit more to get you home safely).<br><br> 

3.	Eat a good meal before you start drinking, or enjoy some snacks while you drink. This helps to slow down the effect of alcohol on your body.<br><br>

4.	Drink water regularly whilst you’re out drinking as it will help you cut down the number of standard drinks you consume and avoid a hangover the next day and also when you get home to keep hydrated.<br><br> 

5.	The guidelines are lower than you might think – women should not regularly drink more than 1 standard drink per day and men 2. <br><br>

20.	Drinking unknown amounts or types of alcohol prevents observing when you have had enough. Knowing exactly what you are putting into your body is a good thing!<br><br>

21.	use the buddy system when drinking, which simply means taking along a friend or friends to drinking events.<br><br>

24.	If you do drive to a party in which you plan to drink, make plans to spend the night and sleep off the effects of alcohol.<br><br>

39.	 Your hair also relies on your body being hydrated. Regular drinking can leave you with dry and brittle hair. Excessive drinking depletes iron and can cause hair loss.<br><br>

40.	A few too many drinks before bedtime and you might think you’re getting off to sleep quickly, but an excess of alcohol means you can go straight into deep sleep missing out the usual first stage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Instead of having typically 6-7 cycles of REM sleep you’ll only have 1-2 meaning you’ll wake up feeling tired.<br><br>

41.	Drinking also causes heartburn and because it relaxes the muscles in your body including the throat, it increases your likelihood of snoring. For a great night’s sleep, make that nightcap a glass of water.<br><br>

42.	Alcohol can do more than leave you struggling to remember the events of the night before. Over time, heavy drinking can lead to memory loss problems – in particular, a Vitamin B1 deficiency causes Wernicke-Korsakoff's Syndrome – a dementia-like illness.<br><br>

43.	People who drink too much are often overweight - and as a result, can go on to develop diabetes. Although the condition is manageable, diabetes can reduce your lifespan and require a careful diet as well as daily medication or insulin injections.<br><br>

44.	Drinking in moderation can help to lower your risk of heart attack and stroke.<br><br>
45.	 For both men and women, too much alcohol lowers your fertility. As few as five drinks a week reduces a woman's chance of becoming pregnant and in men regularly drinking too much can lower sperm count.<br><br>

49.	 People who fall asleep outside after drinking alcohol are at risk of hypothermia and even death. Even if you’re still awake, if it’s a cold night and you’re not dressed for the weather, there’s still a risk of hypothermia.<br><br>

50.	 Finding a taxi can be difficult late at night, so you might want to book one in advance. And make sure you keep some money back so you can pay for it. If you're walking, walk with someone you know and trust.<br><br>

51.	 If you have to walk alone, stick to well-lit and well-used routes and keep your mobile handy. Let someone know what you're doing if you can and call them when you get home.<br><br>

52.	 Try to find ways to get out and have fun that don't always involve alcohol.<br><br>

53.	Avoid drinking in rounds and don't be pushed into drinking more than you'd like to.<br><br>

54.	If you're feeling the pressure to drink when you're out, there are lots of tricks you can use such as alternating 'or spacing' alcohol with soft drinks or water, or ordering a small glass of wine rather than a large one to stop you from overdoing it.<br><br>

55.	Eat a good meal before you start drinking, or enjoy some snacks while you drink. This helps to slow down the effect of alcohol on your body.<br><br>
