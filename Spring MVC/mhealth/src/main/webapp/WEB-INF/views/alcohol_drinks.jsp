					The alcoholic content in a beverage is determined relative to its proof, which is twice the alcohol content. For example, a glass of 24 proof wine would be 12 percent alcohol. A drink that is 40 percent alcohol would be 80 proof. There are three main categories of alcoholic drinks: beer, wine, and distilled spirits (hard liquor).<br><br>
Beer making has a long history. As far back as 2000 B.C., the Code of Hammurabi set standards for beer production and behavioral codes pertaining to drunkenness. Beer is made from grain, malt, hops, yeast, and water. Historically, beer was full-bodied and quite nutritious. The beer of today is highly filtered and of negligible nutritious value, although calorie-laden. The alcohol content of beer in the United States is generally between three and six percent. Grain drinks with a higher level of alcohol are called malts, lager, or ale.<br><br>
Wine also has a long history. Historically, many monasteries have been known for their wine production. A number of fruits can be used to make wine, including grapes, berries, or peaches. The fruits are crushed, and yeast may be added. In general, the darker the color of wine, the longer the aging process. American wine is approximately 9 to 14 percent alcohol. Fortified wines are those with an alcohol content higher than 14 percent. Such wines contain added alcohol or brandy to increase the alcohol content to approximately 20 percent.<br><br>
The remaining major category of alcoholic drink is distilled spirits, often called "hard liquor." The natural fermentation process stops when the alcohol content reaches 14 percent. However, the discovery of the distillation process by the Arabs lead to the use of this type of beverage with its higher alcoholic content. Distillation involves heating the substance of choice and capturing the steam that is released. When cooled, the steam contains less water and more alcohol. A number of different products are used for distilled spirits including corn (bourbon), potatoes (vodka), sugar cane (rum), wine (brandy), and malts/grains (scotch).<br><br>

It is difficult for many people to ascertain exactly how much alcohol is found in a drink. A good rule of thumb is that a 12-ounce, 10 proof beer is equal to a five-ounce glass of 24 proof wine, which is equal to a 1 1/2 ounce shot (jigger) of 80 proof hard liquor (distilled spirits). Each of these drinks contains 0.6 ounces of alcohol. To determine how much ethanol (alcohol) is in a drink, divide the proof by half, and then divide that number by 100. Multiply the result by the number of ounces in the drink. Remember that proof is twice the percent of alcohol.<br><br>

					If you know the percent of the drink, step 1 (finding the percent) can be eliminated.<br>
					Other types of alcohol are not safe to drink. They can be toxic and even fatal if consumed. They include:<br>
					•	<strong>Butyl alcohol</strong>, also known as butanol. This type of alcohol, derived from butane, is commonly used in products such as adhesives and varnishes.<br>
					•	<strong>Methyl alcohol</strong>, also known as methanol or wood alcohol. It is used in the manufacture of formaldehyde and as industrial solvent. During Prohibition wood alcohol gained notoriety as a mixing agent with ethyl alcohol to make liquor. Several people became blind after drinking this toxic mixture, as methyl alcohol causes swelling of the optic nerve, an irreversible condition.<br>
					•	<strong>Isopropyl alcohol</strong>, also known as rubbing alcohol, is a common household product. It is used as a disinfectant and as an ingredient in cologne and after-shave lotion.<br>
					•	<strong>Ethylene glycol</strong>, also known as antifreeze, is the most harmful type of alcohol. It should never be consumed, as it is deadly.<br>

					<p>
					<b>Fermentation</b> is a natural process in which airborne yeast settles on overripe fruits, honey, grain products, etc., and feeds on the sugars. The yeast breaks down certain starches in the sugars, and from this process ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide are produced. In natural fermentation, when the alcohol content reaches a potency of approximately 14 to 15 percent, the process ends.<br><br>

					<b>Distillation</b> of alcohol increases its potency. This process, which was first developed around 800 A.D., involves collecting the steam from boiled alcoholic mash (wine, fruit, grain, etc.). The steam, which has a higher alcoholic content, is collected in a special apparatus. When cooled, the resulting liquid has a high alcohol content and a low water volume.<br><br>
					The term proof is a measurement of the alcohol content of a beverage. Proof can be defined as twice the alcohol content of a drink. For example, a bottle of liquor that is designated as 110 proof would contain 55 percent alcohol.<br><br>
					
					
					<b>Wines</b> are made from a variety of fruits, such as grapes, peaches, plums or apricots. The most common wines are produced from grapes. The soil in which the grapes are grown and the weather conditions in the growing season determine the quality and taste of the grapes which in turn affects the taste and quality of wines. When ripe, the grapes are crushed and fermented in large vats to produce wine.<br><br>
					<b>Beer</b> is also made by the process of fermentation. A liquid mix, called wort, is prepared by combining yeast and malted cereal, such as corn, rye, wheat or barely. Fermentation of this liquid mix produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. The process of fermentation is stopped before it is completed to limit the alcohol content. The alcohol so produced is called beer. It contains 4 to 8 percent of alcohol.<br><br>
					<b>Whisky</b> is made by distilling the fermented juice of cereal grains such as corn, rye or barley. Scotch whisky was originally made in Scotland. The word "Scotch" has become almost synonymous with whisky of good quality. <br><br>
					<b>Rum</b> is a distilled beverage made from fermented molasses or sugarcane juice and is aged for at least three years. Caramel is sometimes used for coloring.<br><br> 
					<b>Brandy</b> is distilled from fermented fruit juices. Brandy is usually aged in oak casks. The color of brandy comes either from the casks or from caramel that is added.<br><br> 
					<b>Gin</b> is a distilled beverage. It is a combination of alcohol, water and various flavors. Gin does not improve with age, so it is not stored in wooden casks. <br><br>
					<b>Liquors</b> are made by adding sugar and flavoring such as fruits, herbs or flowers to brandy or to a combination of alcohol and water. Most liqueurs contain 20-65 per cent alcohol. They are usually consumed in small quantities after dinner.<br><br>
					
					What type of alcohol is in the alcohol drinks we consume?<br>
					The type of alcohol in the alcoholic drinks we drink is a chemical called ethanol.<br><br>
					How is alcohol made?<br>
					To make alcohol, you need to put grains, fruits or vegetables through a process called fermentation (when yeast or bacteria react with the sugars in food - the by-products are ethanol and carbon dioxide).<br><br>
					
					What is fermentation?<br>
					Wine and cider are made by fermenting fruit, while fermented cereals such as barley and rye form the basis of beer and spirits.  A drink's alcohol content is affected by how long it's left to ferment.  Spirits also go through a process called distillation – where a proportion of the water is removed, leaving a stronger concentration of alcohol and flavor.<br>

				      	  <strong>Women and Alcohol</strong><br><br>
Women absorb alcohol into the bloodstream faster and metabolize it slower than men.<br>

Women who drink regularly are at significantly greater risk for liver damage than men even if they drink less or drink for a shorter period of time.<br>

Women develop alcoholic liver disease after a comparatively shorter period of heavy drinking and at a lower level of daily drinking than men.<br>

Proportionately more alcoholic women die from cirrhosis than do alcoholic men.<br>

The odds of women experiencing sexual aggression were nine times higher on heavy days of alcohol consumption compared with days of no alcohol consumption.<br>

There is a greater incidence of alcohol misuse in women with eating disorders, especially bulimia, than in the general population.<br>

Girls who start dieting in sixth grade are more likely to engage in alcohol misuse later in life.<br>

A growing body of literature shows that substance abuse among women and the issues surrounding their abuse differ from that among men.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol and Athletic Ability </strong><br><br>
Moderate use (2-3 drinks) can results a loss of motor coordination for up to 12 to 18 hours after drinking<br>

Moderate use (2-3 drinks) can also result in depleted aerobic capacity and negative impact on endurance for up to 48 hours after the last drink has been consumed.<br><br>

<strong>Unintentional Injury</strong><br><br>
Alcohol consumption by college students is linked to at least 1,400 student deaths and 500,000 unintentional injuries each year.<br>

Evidence links a high proportion of deaths from falls, fires and burns and drownings to drinking.<br>

Various studies estimate that between 13% and 63% of falls are alcohol related.<br>

A common cause of fire among intoxicated people is falling asleep or passing out before extinguishing a cigarette.<br>

Alcohol use is implicated in one-third of drownings.<br>

8% of all ER visits each year for illness or injuries are associated with alcohol.<br><br>

<strong>Date Rape</strong><br><br>
Alcohol or other drugs was a factor with 75% of the men and 55% of the women in reported acquaintance rapes on college campuses.<br>

Alcohol is the number one date rape drug.<br>

More than three-quarters of female victims of nonfatal domestic violence reported that their assailant had been drinking or using drugs.<br><br>

<strong>Tolerance</strong><br><br>
Alcohol does not relieve depression - it makes it worse.<br>

Tolerance is the lessening of the effectiveness of alcohol after a period of prolonged or heavy use.<br>

Tolerance means you may not feel the same effects of alcohol as you continue to use, but your blood alcohol concentration level may remain high.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol and Depression</strong><br><br>
One third of suicides are associated with alcohol misuse.<br>

Approximately 5% of college students report experiencing poor mental health and this coincides with a high risk for alcohol abuse.<br>

Ages 18-24 coincides with the peak years for onset and intensification of the most common mental health problems among youth - including alcohol abuse.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol and the Body</strong><br><br>
Alcohol goes directly to the bloodstream, which is why it effects every system in the body.<br>

Excessive drinking can decrease the amount of testosterone in a man's body and cause impotence.<br>

Alcohol is a nervous system depressant.<br>

Alcohol is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestine, and less rapidly from the stomach and colon.<br>

A pulse rate lower than 40 is a medical emergency. Call 911!<br>

A respiration (breaths) rate lower than 8-10 per minute is a medical emergency. Call 911!<br>

A daily glass of wine will add 10 pounds per year.<br>

The peak Blood Alcohol Level occurs 60 to 90 minutes after ingestion when the stomach is empty.<br>

The presence of food in the stomach slows the rate of alcohol absorption. However the amount of alcohol absorbed remains unchanged.<br>

Vomiting is part of the automatic defense system of the body activated to prevent more alcohol from being absorbed.<br>

When a person's blood alcohol level ranges from .02 g/100ml to .08 g/100ml he/she usually has a change in mood and may have trouble interpreting what he/she sees and hears.<br>

Birth control pills slow down the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the body<br>

If someone passes out and will not respond to attempts to wake them, it is very possible they are suffering from alcohol poisoning.<br>

Several factors influence how alcohol will affect a person: age, gender, physical condition, amount of food eaten and other drugs or medicines taken.<br>

The path of alcohol in the body is the mouth, stomach, small intestine, heart, brain and the liver.<br>

Individuals with the same weight, but different muscle builds will differ in their BAC.<br>

Individuals with more muscle are less affected by alcohol because the muscle contains water that absorbs the alcohol from the bloodstream.<br>

Premenstrual hormonal changes cause a faster increase in BAC during the days right before a woman gets her period.<br><br>

<strong>Chronic Alcohol Use</strong><br><br>
Chronic alcohol use can damage the frontal lobes of the brain.<br>

Chronic alcohol use can cause an overall reduction in brain size.<br>

More than half of current drinkers have a family history of alcoholism.<br><br>

<strong>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</strong><br><br>
Pregnant women who drink risk having babies with fetal alcohol syndrome.<br>

Babies born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have: smaller heads and brains, some degree of mental retardation, poor coordination, hyperactivity and abnormal facial features.<br>

10% of alcohol health care costs are for care of fetal alcohol syndrome.<br><br>

<strong>Adult Drinking Behaviors</strong><br><br>
Binge Drinking is more common in men than in women.<br>
Six in 10 U.S. adults were current drinkers in 1999-2001 and about 1 in 4 were lifetime abstainers.<br>

Nearly one-third of adults were classified as light drinkers (3 or fewer drinks per week).<br>
Nearly 5 percent of adults were classified as heavier drinkers (7 or more drinks per week for women; 14 or more for men).<br>

About 20 percent of adults had 5 or more drinks per day at least once in the past year.<br><br>

<strong>Definitions</strong><br><br>
Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the amount of alcohol present in the blood when consuming alcohol.<br>

A blackout is an amnesia-like period that is often associated with drinking. A person may be functioning normally, but later, the person has no memory of occurrences.<br>

During a blackout, an individual can participate in a significant, emotionally charged event but have no recollection of what occurred.<br>

When blood alcohol levels rise slowly, people are less likely to experience blackouts, even if they eventually become intoxicated.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol Beverage Facts</strong><br>
Most wine coolers have the same amount of alcohol as a 12-oz. beer.<br>

One 12-oz. beer, one 5-oz. glass of wine and one 1.5 oz. shot of liquor have the same amount of alcohol.<br>

Ethanol or Ethyl Alcohol - Beverage alcohol is produced by fermenting or distilling various fruits, vegetables or grains.<br>

In addition to being a depressant, alcohol is a chemical solvent, a local anesthetic and an irritant.<br>
Alcohol is found in many beverages, also in many prescription and non-prescription drugs.<br><br>

<strong>Treatment</strong><br><br>
Recent studies show that after six months, treatment for alcoholism is successful for 40 to 70% of participants.<br>

Substance abuse treatment is less expensive than the alternatives, such as incarceration.<br>

More than 18 million people who use alcohol need substance abuse treatment.<br>
Overall, fewer than one-fourth of those needing treatment for substance abuse get it.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol and Advertising</strong><br><br>
The alcohol industry spent more than $1 billion on television, radio, print and outdoor advertising in 1997.<br>

The total number of alcohol ads on network, local and cable television increased to 289,381 in 2002, a 39% hike from 2001.<br>

Spending for alcohol ads on T.V. by the alcohol industry grew by 22%, to more than $990 million in 2002.<br>

Youth 12-20 were more likely on a per capita basis than adults to have seen 66,218 alcohol ads, a 30% increase over 2001.<br><br>

<strong>Youth and Drinking</strong><br><br>
One third of all twelfth graders have been drunk in the past 30 days.<br>

Among high school seniors, whites are most likely and blacks least likely to be heavy drinkers.<br>

Nearly four out of every five students (77%) have consumed alcohol by the end of high school.<br>

In 2003, more than half (58%) of 12th graders reported having been drunk at least once in their life.<br>

In 2003 the proportion of 12th graders who admitted drinking an alcoholic beverage in the past 30 days was 48%<br>

College athletes tend to drink more than peers who are not involved with campus-based sports.<br>

In terms of size, students at smaller colleges tend to drink more than students at larger schools.<br>

The number of college students who do not drink has increased to approximately 20%.<br>

Approximately one in three 18-to-24-year-olds admitted to emergency rooms for serious injuries is intoxicated.<br>

About one-half of all fatal traffic crashes among those aged 18 to 24 involve alcohol.<br>

The perception that alcohol use is socially acceptable correlates with the fact that more than 80% of American youth consume alcohol before their 21st birthday.<br>

In a recent study, 31% of students met criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and 6% for alcohol dependence in the past 12 months.<br>

Members of fraternities and sororities tend to drink more than students who do not participate in the Greek system.<br>

A study recently revealed that heavy drinking among members of Greek organizations does not generally lead to increased alcohol use later in life.<br>

30% of students who drank in the past year said they had driven after drinking alcohol during the past 30 days.<br>

Rates of heavy alcohol use are highest among those with less than a college degree.<br><br>

Deaths from alcohol use highest for black males, though white males are more likely to drink.<br>

Heavy alcohol use is relatively more common among people living in small metropolitan areas than in large metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan areas.<br>

Heavy drinking is highest among those living in the North Central region of the U.S.<br>

					A drink can come in many forms. It can be a shot of hard liquor or a mixed drink containing vodka, rum, tequila, gin, scotch, or some other liquor. It can also be wine, a wine cooler, beer, or malt liquor.<br><br> 

					A standard drink is any drink that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol (about 0.6 fluid ounces or 1.2 tablespoons). This is the amount of alcohol usually found in:<br>
					•	One 12-ounce beer;<br>
					•	One 4- to 5-ounce glass of wine; and<br>
					•	One 1.5-ounce shot of 80-proof liquor.<br>
