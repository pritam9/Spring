				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>A hangover is a tell-tale sign you’ve over-indulged. Most
						symptoms are brought about by dehydration – such as a banging
						headache, nausea, feeling tired and sluggish. The best thing you
						can do is to drink plenty of water, eat a potassium rich snack
						like a banana and go for a stroll to get some fresh air Alcohol is
						packed with calories that contain no nutritional value. A large
						glass of red wine contains almost as much as a slice of cake! A 5%
						pint of lager is 240-250 calories – that’s the equivalent of a
						burger! At 7 calories a gram that’s almost as much as pure fat!</p>
					<p>Mood: When we drink low or moderate amounts of alcohol, it
						tends to amplify our emotions. So if we’re happy, we can feel
						better – but if we’re not so happy we tend to feel worse. Drinking
						alcohol can lead to and be a symptom of poor mental health such as
						anxiety and depression.</p>
					<p>Anxiety: Did you know alcohol uses up natural chemicals in
						the brain? These chemicals are vital to reducing anxiety and
						lifting mood. So it can be easy to become trapped in a cycle of
						drinking to make yourself feel better, without realizing you’re
						probably just making the problem worse.</p>
					<p>Skin: Alcohol dehydrates the skin and depletes it of
						essential nutrients, making your skin appear dull and tired.
						Drinking alcohol also dilates the facial blood vessels, making you
						more susceptible to spidery red thread veins. Pre-existing skin
						conditions like Psoriasis and Rosacea are both made worse by
						alcohol.</p>
					<p>Nails: Strong, healthy nails rely on a balanced intake of
						nutrients and plenty of water. Brittle nails could be one sign
						you’re drinking more than you think.</p>
					<p>Hair: Your hair also relies on your body being hydrated.
						Regular drinking can leave you with dry and brittle hair.
						Excessive drinking depletes iron and can cause hair loss.</p>
					<p>Sleep: A few too many drinks before bedtime and you might
						think you’re getting off to sleep quickly, but an excess of
						alcohol means you can go straight into deep sleep missing out the
						usual first stage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Instead of
						having typically 6-7 cycles of REM sleep, you’ll only have 1-2,
						meaning you’ll wake up feeling tired.</p>
					<p>Up in the night: When you’ve been drinking you’re more
						likely to get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet
						too. Drinking also causes heartburn and because it relaxes the
						muscles in your body including the throat, it increases your
						likelihood of snoring. For a great night’s sleep, make that
						nightcap a glass of water.</p>
					<p>Feeling Stressed: It can be all too easy to let alcohol
						become a habit when trying to unwind after another hard day. But
						it isn’t a good idea. Drinking alcohol stops us from sleeping
						properly and together with a hangover can make life more difficult
						all round. All of which just leads to more stress.</p>
					<p>Memory: Alcohol can do more than leave you struggling to
						remember the events of the night before. Over time, heavy drinking
						can lead to memory loss problems – in particular, a Vitamin B1
						deficiency causes Wernicke-Korsakoff's Syndrome – a dementia-like
						illness.</p>

				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Having a night out? Make sure you stay safe. Remember that
						alcohol can put you at greater risk of crime. And that it can
						impair your judgment which can make you misinterpret people and
						even respond inappropriately if you think you're being provoked.
						By looking out for friends and taking a few simple precautions,
						you can make sure your big night is memorable for all the right
						reasons.</p>
					<p>Assault: 70% of assaults at Emergency Departments were
						likely to have been alcohol-related.Alcohol can make us more
						aggressive which is why fights often start after we’ve been
						drinking. It reduces our ability to think straight. You’re less
						likely to misinterpret someone’s behavior or social cues if you
						haven’t been drinking. If you’re being provoked by someone who has
						been drinking, the best advice is to walk away.</p>
					<p>House fires: When you’ve had a few drinks, it’s all too easy
						to leave the stove on, or not stub out a cigarette properly. A
						recent report indicated that alcohol was a contributory factor in
						almost 3 in 10 fatal house fires.</p>
					<p>Hypothermia: Although it makes us feel warmer, alcohol
						lowers core body temperature. People who fall asleep outside after
						drinking alcohol are at risk of hypothermia and even death. Even
						if you’re still awake, if it’s a cold night and you’re not dressed
						for the weather, there’s still a risk of hypothermia.</p>
					<p>Getting home safely: Finding a taxi can be difficult late at
						night, so you might want to book one in advance. And make sure you
						keep some money back so you can pay for it. If you're walking,
						walk with someone you know and trust. If you have to walk alone,
						stick to well-lit and well-used routes and keep your mobile handy.
						Let someone know what you're doing if you can and call them when
						you get home.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading">3. Sensible Drinking Guidelines:</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Every drink we have adds up, and over time it can have a
						bigger impact on our health and well-being than we realize. That's
						why it's important to stick to the sensible drinking guidelines.</p>
					<p>Women shouldn't regularly drink more than 2-3 units
						(equivalent to a 175ml glass of 13% wine) of alcohol a day, and
						men 3-4 units (equivalent to a pint and a half of 4% lager). We
						should all try to take at least two alcohol-free days a week to
						give our body a break.</p>
					<p>Women can drink just as much as men if they want. Not true.
						With smaller bodies (including smaller livers) and a different
						physical make-up, alcohol affects women differently – which is why
						the sensible drinking guidelines for women are lower.</p>
					<p>You don't have to be knocking back several pints every night
						in the pub for alcohol to damage your health. The truth is, over
						half of us do our drinking at home nowadays. Those generous home
						measures can mean you're regularly drinking over the sensible
						drinking guidelines without even realizing it. Here are just some
						of the ways alcohol can affect your overall health and well-being.
					</p>
					<p>Over time, regularly drinking more than the sensible
						drinking guidelines will affect your appearance and general
						health. But it can also disrupt your sleep and lead to an
						increased risk of high blood pressure, cause chronic liver disease
						to develop, and even increase your risk of breast cancer.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading">4. Alcohol &amp; Men's Bodies</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Most of us enjoy a drink now and then, at home or when we
						get together with friends. But are you drinking more than you
						think? 28% of men drink 3 or more times a week. Men drink more on
						average than women and unsurprisingly as a result, men suffer more
						ill effects.</p>
					<p>A beer belly is one of the most obvious results of drinking
						too much, but it’s more than just a turn-off – having a beer belly
						can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood
						pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea and cancer.</p>
					<p>Fertility: For both men and women, too much alcohol lowers
						your fertility. As few as five drinks a week reduces a woman's
						chance of becoming pregnant and in men regularly drinking too much
						can lower sperm count.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading">5. Hidden Calories</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>At 7 calories per gram, alcohol has more calories than many
						foods. Cutting back on the amount you drink is a great way to
						detox and reduce the amount of calories you're consuming.</p>
					<p>For many of us, drinking sensibly is key to controlling our
						weight. After all, at 7 calories per gram, alcohol has nearly as
						many calories as pure fat! As you might know, there are almost 200
						calories in just one large glass of wine! That’s nearly as many as
						a four chocolate covered cookies or packet of potato chips! Two
						beers – at nearly 300 calories that’s almost as many as a lunch
						time sandwich.</p>
					<p>Increasing your appetite: Alcohol both stimulates our
						appetite and reduces our self-control, making it far too easy to
						eat too much. This explains why you reach for another packet of
						potato chips when you’re having a drink at home and crave high
						fat, salty junk food at the end of a night out.</p>
					<p>Empty calories: Calories from alcohol are ‘empty’ calories.
						They have no nutritional value. If you have a drink while cooking
						or watching the TV before dinner you could have consumed around
						250 calories before you even tuck in!</p>
					<p>Extra pounds: Drinking alcohol reduces the amount of fat
						your body burns for energy. While our bodies store nutrients,
						protein and carbohydrates, it can’t store alcohol and so our
						systems want to get rid of it first. As a result, the calories in
						alcohol are metabolized by our bodies ahead of burning fat or
						absorbing nutrients – bad news for your waistline.</p>
					<p>Think about what you drink: By taking simple steps to drink
						responsibly such as opting for a small rather than a large glass
						of wine, measuring your drinks at home using a measuring cup, or
						keeping a drinks diary, you can start to make a difference to your
						waistline and your health.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading">6. Sexual Health</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Drinking loosens your inhibitions, affects your judgement,
						and might result in you making decisions you regret. For example,
						it might make you vulnerable to taking risks like having
						unprotected sex. Plan ahead and carry a condom with you, it could
						decrease your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, or
						having an unwanted pregnancy.</p>
					<p>Date Rape: If we’re drunk and can’t look out for ourselves
						properly, we’re at risk of being taken advantage of sexually.
						Don’t accept drinks from strangers, stick to sensible drinking
						guidelines and watch your drink at all times. If you're going out
						let people know where you are and who you are with. Make sure you
						take your cell phone and have plenty of cash. If you’re out with
						friends look after each other and stick together.</p>
