				<div class="panel-heading">The Visible Effects (both Men and
					Women)</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>A hangover is a tell-tale sign you’ve over-indulged. Most
						symptoms are brought about by dehydration – such as a banging
						headache, nausea, feeling tired and sluggish. The best thing you
						can do is to drink plenty of water, eat a potassium rich snack
						like a banana and go for a stroll to get some fresh air Alcohol is
						packed with calories that contain no nutritional value. A large
						glass of red wine contains almost as much as a slice of cake! A 5%
						pint of lager is 240-250 calories – that’s the equivalent of a
						burger! At 7 calories a gram that’s almost as much as pure fat!</p>
					<p>Mood: When we drink low or moderate amounts of alcohol, it
						tends to amplify our emotions. So if we’re happy, we can feel
						better – but if we’re not so happy we tend to feel worse. Drinking
						alcohol can lead to and be a symptom of poor mental health such as
						anxiety and depression.</p>
					<p>Anxiety: Did you know alcohol uses up natural chemicals in
						the brain? These chemicals are vital to reducing anxiety and
						lifting mood. So it can be easy to become trapped in a cycle of
						drinking to make yourself feel better, without realizing you’re
						probably just making the problem worse.</p>
					<p>Skin: Alcohol dehydrates the skin and depletes it of
						essential nutrients, making your skin appear dull and tired.
						Drinking alcohol also dilates the facial blood vessels, making you
						more susceptible to spidery red thread veins. Pre-existing skin
						conditions like Psoriasis and Rosacea are both made worse by
						alcohol.</p>
					<p>Nails: Strong, healthy nails rely on a balanced intake of
						nutrients and plenty of water. Brittle nails could be one sign
						you’re drinking more than you think.</p>
					<p>Hair: Your hair also relies on your body being hydrated.
						Regular drinking can leave you with dry and brittle hair.
						Excessive drinking depletes iron and can cause hair loss.</p>
					<p>Sleep: A few too many drinks before bedtime and you might
						think you’re getting off to sleep quickly, but an excess of
						alcohol means you can go straight into deep sleep missing out the
						usual first stage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Instead of
						having typically 6-7 cycles of REM sleep, you’ll only have 1-2,
						meaning you’ll wake up feeling tired.</p>
					<p>Up in the night: When you’ve been drinking you’re more
						likely to get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet
						too. Drinking also causes heartburn and because it relaxes the
						muscles in your body including the throat, it increases your
						likelihood of snoring. For a great night’s sleep, make that
						nightcap a glass of water.</p>
					<p>Feeling Stressed: It can be all too easy to let alcohol
						become a habit when trying to unwind after another hard day. But
						it isn’t a good idea. Drinking alcohol stops us from sleeping
						properly and together with a hangover can make life more difficult
						all round. All of which just leads to more stress.</p>
					<p>Memory: Alcohol can do more than leave you struggling to
						remember the events of the night before. Over time, heavy drinking
						can lead to memory loss problems – in particular, a Vitamin B1
						deficiency causes Wernicke-Korsakoff's Syndrome – a dementia-like
						illness.</p>

				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Having a night out? Make sure you stay safe. Remember that
						alcohol can put you at greater risk of crime. And that it can
						impair your judgment which can make you misinterpret people and
						even respond inappropriately if you think you're being provoked.
						By looking out for friends and taking a few simple precautions,
						you can make sure your big night is memorable for all the right
						reasons.</p>
					<p>Assault: 70% of assaults at Emergency Departments were
						likely to have been alcohol-related.Alcohol can make us more
						aggressive which is why fights often start after we’ve been
						drinking. It reduces our ability to think straight. You’re less
						likely to misinterpret someone’s behavior or social cues if you
						haven’t been drinking. If you’re being provoked by someone who has
						been drinking, the best advice is to walk away.</p>
					<p>House fires: When you’ve had a few drinks, it’s all too easy
						to leave the stove on, or not stub out a cigarette properly. A
						recent report indicated that alcohol was a contributory factor in
						almost 3 in 10 fatal house fires.</p>
					<p>Hypothermia: Although it makes us feel warmer, alcohol
						lowers core body temperature. People who fall asleep outside after
						drinking alcohol are at risk of hypothermia and even death. Even
						if you’re still awake, if it’s a cold night and you’re not dressed
						for the weather, there’s still a risk of hypothermia.</p>
					<p>Getting home safely: Finding a taxi can be difficult late at
						night, so you might want to book one in advance. And make sure you
						keep some money back so you can pay for it. If you're walking,
						walk with someone you know and trust. If you have to walk alone,
						stick to well-lit and well-used routes and keep your mobile handy.
						Let someone know what you're doing if you can and call them when
						you get home.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading">Sensible Drinking Guidelines:</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Every drink we have adds up, and over time it can have a
						bigger impact on our health and wellbeing than we realize. That's
						why it's important to stick to the sensible drinking guidelines.
						Women shouldn't regularly drink more than 2-3 units (equivalent to
						a 175ml glass of 13% wine) of alcohol a day, and men 3-4 units
						(equivalent to a pint and a half of 4% lager). We should all try
						to take at least two alcohol-free days a week to give our body a
						break. Women can drink just as much as men if they want. Not true.
						With smaller bodies (including smaller livers) and a different
						physical make-up, alcohol affects women differently â which is
						why the sensible drinking guidelines for women are lower. - You
						don't have to be knocking back several pints every night in the
						pub for alcohol to damage your health. The truth is, over half of
						us do our drinking at home nowadays. Those generous home measures
						can mean you're regularly drinking over the sensible drinking
						guidelines without even realizing it. Here are just some of the
						ways alcohol can affect your overall health and wellbeing. Over
						time, regularly drinking more than the sensible drinking
						guidelines will affect your appearance and general health. But it
						can also disrupt your sleep and lead to an increased risk of high
						blood pressure, cause chronic liver disease to develop, and even
						increase your risk of breast cancer.</p>

				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Most of us enjoy a drink now and then, at home or when we
						get together with friends. But are you drinking more than you
						think? 28% of men drink 3 or more times a week. Men drink more on
						average than women and unsurprisingly as a result, men suffer more
						ill effects. A beer belly is one of the most obvious results of
						drinking too much, but itâs more than just a turn-off â having
						a beer belly can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease,
						high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea and cancer. Fertility
						For both men and women, too much alcohol lowers your fertility. As
						few as five drinks a week reduces a woman's chance of becoming
						pregnant and in men regularly drinking too much can lower sperm
						count.</p>

				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>Womenâs bodies react to alcohol in a different way to
						menâs. Women have on average 10% more fat than men, which mean
						thereâs less body fluid to dilute alcohol, so it travels around
						womenâs bodies in more concentrated form and causes more harm.

						Womenâs livers produce less of the substance the body uses to
						break alcohol down (an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase). This
						means not only do women get drunk quicker but the effects last
						longer too. Alcohol dehydrates the skin and depletes it of
						essential nutrients, making your skin appear dull and tired and
						your hair and nails brittle. Drinking alcohol also dilates the
						facial blood vessels, making you more susceptible to spidery red
						thread veins. Pre-existing skin conditions like Psoriasis and
						Rosacea are both made worse by alcohol. Just one large glass of
						red wine contains around 200 calories â almost the same as four
						chocolate cookies or a packet of potato chips! (1). At 7 calories
						a gram, alcohol contains more calories than many foods - bad news
						for your waistline. Alcohol also stimulates our appetite, but
						reduces our self-control, so youâre more likely to give in to
						unhealthy snacks or late night suppers. Alcohol reduces the amount
						of fat your body burns for energy. The calories in alcohol are
						metabolized by the body first before it burns fat or absorbs
						nutrients, making us less likely to absorb essential vitamins and
						more prone to gain weight. Sticking to the sensible drinking
						guidelines can help you maintain a healthy weight. The risk of
						breast cancer increases from drinking as little as 1-2 units a day
						(thatâs one small (125ml) glass of 12% wine) In Scotland alone,
						500 new cases of breast cancer each year could be linked to
						alcohol consumption. A recent study has shown that the risk of
						breast cancer increases by 7-11% for every unit drunk. The chronic
						liver disease rate amongst 30-44 year old women in Scotland has
						trebled since the mid to late 1980s. Itâs important to remember
						that you donât have to have a hangover to be doing damage to
						your liver. Alcohol lowers sperm count in men and fertility in
						women. A recent study by the British Medical Journal suggested
						that as few as five or less drinks every week would decrease a
						woman's chance of becoming pregnant. The best advice is, if you
						want to conceive, avoid alcohol completely. A few days before a
						period, and during ovulation, youâll feel the effects of alcohol
						more quickly. But beware, the pill has the opposite effect, it
						delays the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream and the time
						it takes to leave your body so you won't be as aware of the
						effects and might drink more than you realize. Itâs likely to
						take a woman longer than a man to recover from the damage caused
						by a big night. Taking two days off alcohol every week is a great
						way to give your body a break, particularly after an indulgent
						night There is evidence that even drinking one or two units a day
						can lead to health and development problems for baby. Any alcohol
						you drink while pregnant will reach your baby via the placenta and
						may cause harm. The simple fact is, alcohol and pregnancy just
						don't mix. When you're pregnant, the health of your unborn baby
						will obviously be the most important consideration - and drinking
						while pregnant could result in birth defects Even small quantities
						of alcohol can cause Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal
						Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). FAS and FASD can cause
						life-long learning and behavioral problems, so the choices you
						make now can have life-long effects on your child.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading">Hidden Calories (Women)</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>At 7 calories per gram, alcohol has more calories than many
						foods. Cutting back on the amount you drink is a great way to
						detox and reduce the amount of calories you're consuming. For many
						of us, drinking sensibly is key to controlling our weight. After
						all, at 7 calories per gram, alcohol has nearly as many calories
						as pure fat! As you might know, there are almost 200 calories in
						just one large glass of wine! Thatâs nearly as many as a four
						chocolate covered cookies or packet of potato chips! Two beers â
						at nearly 300 calories thatâs almost as many as a lunchtime
						sandwich Increasing your appetite. Alcohol both stimulates our
						appetite and reduces our self-control, making it far too easy to
						eat too much. Which explains why you reach for another packet of
						potato chips when youâre having a drink at home and crave high
						fat, salty junk food at the end of a night out. - Empty calories:
						Calories from alcohol are âemptyâ calories. They have no
						nutritional value. If you have a drink while cooking or watching
						the TV before dinner you could have consumed around 250 calories
						before you even tuck in! Extra pounds Drinking alcohol reduces the
						amount of fat your body burns for energy. While our bodies store
						nutrients, protein and carbohydrates it canât store alcohol and
						so our systems want to get rid of it first. As a result, the
						calories in alcohol are metabolized by our bodies ahead of burning
						fat or absorbing nutrients â bad news for your waistline. Think
						about what you drink: By taking simple steps to drink responsibly
						such as opting for a small rather than a large glass of wine,
						measuring your drinks at home using a measuring cup, or keeping a
						drinks diary, you can start to make a difference to your waistline
						and your health.</p>

					<p>Drinking loosens your inhibitions, affects your judgement,

				<div class="panel-heading">The Role of Beliefs about Drinking
					in Outcomes in Drinking Behavior on Men and Women</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>
						Not all of the effects of alcohol are related to chemical changes
						in your body. Drinking can cause major changes in your body, but
						the effect of alcohol on social behavior and moods is different.
						The effects of moderate drinking depend less on alcohol and more
						on our thoughts and beliefs that we bring into a drinking
						situation, and on the situation itself. Researchers have found
						that our minds may have more to do with our drinking behavior than
						the alcohol. Psychologists have developed a method for separating
						the "chemical effects of alcohol" from the "psychological effects
						of drinking." <strong> Experiments have shown that people
							will act drunk when they think they are drinking alcohol, even if
							they are really drinking only tonic water! </strong> Researchers have
						found that:
					<ul>
						<li>Men who believe they have been drinking alcohol feel more
							talkative, humorous, bold, aggressive, and less nervous in social
							situations, even when they have not been drinking.</li>
						<li>Women, on the other hand, become more anxious or nervous.
							But both types of responses appear to be determined by
							expectations about what happens when people drink</li>
						<li>Men also tend to believe they are more sexually aroused
							when they think they are drinking alcohol, even when they're not
							physically aroused.</li>
						<li>Women became less physically aroused when drinking.
							Beliefs about alcohol play a less significant role for women when
							compared to men.</li>
					</ul>

					Many experts used to believe that alcoholics develop a craving for
					more liquor after just one or two drinks. However, studies show
					that alcoholics experience the same craving after one or two
					non-alcoholic drinks. Even more surprising, alcoholics report
					little or no craving when given alcoholic drinks if they believe
					the drinks are non-alcoholic. Research has found that for social
					behaviors the expectancy effect can be more powerful than the
					chemical or physiological effects of alcohol. However, for both men
					and women in nonsocial behaviors, such as reaction time or
					performance on various cognitive or motor tasks, alcohol does have
					an adverse effect, regardless of expectations. How do we account
					for this pattern of results? One explanation is that alcohol
					provides a convenient "excuse" for someone to behave in ways that
					are usually disapproved of, like being aggressive and sexual. Based
					on research to date, this explanation applies best to men. An
					individual who acts aggressively after drinking can avoid personal
					responsibility for that behavior by attributing the cause of his
					behavior to alcohol. A drinker also can blame poor results on
					alcohol ("I did poorly on the exam because I had a hangover").
					Research about beliefs of alcohol effects also highlight the
					important role that cultural norms play in drinking behavior. For
					example, if our culture believes that drinking makes us tough, and
					then we act tough when we are drinking, we then believe that
					alcohol has caused the behavior. But the belief came before the
					drinking: the belief about drinking caused us to act tough!
					Cultural beliefs often dictate how alcohol affects us
