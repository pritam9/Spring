				      	  <p>It’s easy to interpret the combination of an alcohol-induced buzz and an energy rush from caffeine as a higher level of “drunk.” But energy drinks don’t actually enhance the relaxed and sociable feeling caused by a few drinks. Instead, caffeine masks the sedative effects of alcohol that often cue people to stop drinking  . As a result, people are tricked into thinking they have more energy than they actually do, which can push them to continue drinking (and potentially lead to negative consequences such as getting too drunk or having a terrible hangover the next day).</p><br>
				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong> Energy drinks alter the perception of how intoxicated we really are, but have no direct effect on how those shots hit us. One exception? Mixing alcohol with diet soda may actually increase intoxication (but in this case it's the lack of sugar, not the caffeine content, that has an effect). While for the most part drinking too much can’t be blamed solely on Red Bull, it’s best to steer clear of this combo to stay aware of your limits and to avoid any possible negative effects caused by drinking too much alcohol or too much caffeine.</p>

				      	  <p>The reigning belief is that beer is a “softer” drink that can’t cause drunkenness as quickly as, say, shots of vodka. Switching to hard liquor after a few beers can make the feeling come on too fast... usually resulting in vomit (or so the myth goes). So, starting with the hard stuff and then slowing down with beer should prevent the spins, right? Not so much.</p><br>
				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>The amount you drink matters more than the type of drinks you consume or how you mix them. Drinking too much of any alcohol too quickly can make you sick, whether it's wine, beer, or liquor. No matter what you're drinking, pacing is key.</p>

				  <div id="demo10" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				      	  <p>Darker beers and wines generally have more antioxidants than light beer and white wine (the darker hues are thought to signify higher flavanoid content in beers and higher polyphenol content in wines). This means that most people conclude that, while these options are sometimes slightly higher in calories, they pack more nutritional value and are therefore inherently healthier than their paler friends.</p><br>
				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>While darker alcohols may contain more antioxidants, they can also contain more cogeners—toxic chemicals created during the fermentation process—which can worsen hangovers (this goes for beer, wine, rum, whiskey, gold tequila, and pretty much any drink with a darkish hue). If you need to avoid feeling sluggish the next day, switch out some of those darker drinks for lighter versions.</p>

				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>It depends on the type of wine. Some are meant to be consumed within one year of production and don’t get any better after time, while others are intended to be stored in a wine cellar for a few years to reach their peak quality. Unfortunately, a wine that sits past its intended expiration date does not get any more impressive with time. In fact, wine’s antioxidant content might actually decrease as it ages.</p>

				      	  <p>Some research has suggested that beer can rehydrate athletes better than water for three key reasons: one, that beer’s vitamins and minerals offer health benefits that water doesn’t have; two, that the carbonation helps quench thirst; and, three, that the carbs help replenish energy stores.</p><br>
				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>In that one study, researchers saw only a slight rehydration benefit over water in the athletes they tested. Sports drinks containing sugars, salt, and potassium can similarly rehydrate an exhausted body without the negative side effects of alcohol. Plus, alcohol's effect on the liver and pancreas causes oxygen to leave the bloodstream more quickly, which inhibits the transport of digestive enzymes and essential nutrients through the body. This slows muscle growth and repair and impairs the metabolism of carbs for energy (Not exactly what the body needs in the middle of a long run or lifting sesh...).</p>

The painkillers can erode the stomach lining, which, coupled with the stomach irritants in alcohol, can cause liver inflammation and allow more alcohol into the bloodstream, resulting in potential liver damage and a higher-than-normal Blood Alcohol Content. Taking ibuprofen or another pain reliever the morning after, however, can help relieve temporary pains.</p>

				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>By the time that pizza hits the stomach, the alcohol consumed has already been absorbed into your system. Greasy food won’t help your liver metabolize the alcohol any faster. In fact, the combination of alcohol and greasy food can actually contribute to acid reflux, meaning you’ll feel even worse in the morning. If you want food to help slow down alcohol absorption, consume a snack or a meal before you start drinking (But don't take this as free license to binge-drink.).</p>

				  <div id="demo17" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				      	  <p>This is a tricky one. Some folks think of light beer as healthier because it tends to contain fewer calories and a slightly lower alcohol content. But those qualities don't necessarily make it a healthier choice.</p><br>
				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>Many people may end up drinking more to compensate for the lower alcohol levels, ultimately consuming more calories than if they’d stuck with full-strength brews  . Also keep in mind that any one brand’s “light” beer is only light relative to that brand’s full-calorie counterpart (and calorie counts and alcohol content vary between brands). And besides, the number of calories in a product isn't the sole determinant of how healthy it is. Instead of automatically opting for a light variety, look for a beer that’s healthier overall.</p>

				  <div id="demo18" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				      	  <p>This is an easy assumption to make if you're observing the often less-than-wise behavior that can result from knocking back a few too many. But an average night of drinking won’t lead to any long-term brain damage.</p><br>
				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>It may impair your thinking, but alcohol doesn’t permanently destroy brain cells. It damages dendrites, which are the little feelers on neurons that convey electrical messages from your brain to your body. Neurons are the cells that act as communicators, triggering motor responses to physical stimuli. For example, if you touch something hot, neurons carry the message from your nerves to your brain, which send the return message to your arm to move your hand off the stove. Dendrite damage interferes with those messages, which can account for all those poorly spelled texts and inability to walk in a straight line (But the effects are not permanent.) That being said, it's important to note that persistent alcohol abuse can indirectly contribute to lasting defects, since alcoholism is often accompanied by other poor health habits like poor nutrition. Overuse of alcohol combined with a lack of nutrients can lead to memory lapses and problems with motor coordination.</p>

				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>A human liver can process about one standard drink every hour (That’s 1.5 oz of hard liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer.) Coffee or a dunk in a brisk shower might wake you up a little, but it won’t speed up the process of eliminating the bad stuff from your system. Time is (unfortunately) the only cure.</p>

				      	  <p>Yes and no. Eating before drinking can slow the absorption of alcohol by the body, but it can’t prevent you from getting drunk.</p><br>
				          <p><strong>The Fact:</strong>The body begins absorbing alcohol through the stomach lining and small intestine, so if your tummy is full of food, it will take longer for the buzz to sink in. This may delay feeling drunk, but it won’t stop it completely. Eventually, the stomach will empty from dinner and alcohol absorption will pick up again. Drinking on an empty stomach is never a good idea, but eating beforehand isn’t a free pass to pound shots, either. As with so many things when it comes to health, moderation is key.</p>

The amount of alcohol it takes to make you pass out is dangerously close to the amount of alcohol it takes to make you dead!</p>

						  <p>Truth: If you don’t call for help, your friend may not live to be mad at you. When someone passes out from drinking too much, they are unconscious and have consumed too much alcohol.

				  <div id="demo61" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				          <p><strong>Fact:</strong>Alcohol can act as both a stimulant and a depressant. The “point of diminishing return” is the BAC that is the peak of the stimulation and euphoria. At this point (.06) alcohol acts as a stimulant. Any higher BAC will result in fewer positive effects. Once the drinker has gone beyond the “point of diminishing return,” it is impossible to return back into the buzzed zone.</p><br>
				          <p>When a person consumes too much alcohol their body’s natural response is to get sleepy, heart rate and blood pressure decrease and breathing slows down. However, caffeine is also a stimulant so it helps to keep your body awake. This is a dangerous mix because the caffeine tricks your body into thinking it is not tired and that you are not as drunk as you really are. Therefore people who drink alcohol and caffeine are more likely to consume more alcohol in one sitting that a person who just drinks alcohol. This increases the risk of alcohol overdose and other risky behaviors.</p><br>

				      	  1.	A large glass of wine can contain over 1.5 standard drinks of alcohol. Think about how that adds up over a night if you’re drinking more than one, and perhaps go for a smaller glass for a change. <br>

2.	Think about how much you’re going to drink before you go on a night out. One way of making sure you don’t go over this is to take only enough money to buy the drinks you want (and a bit more to get you home safely).<br> 

3.	Eat a good meal before you start drinking, or enjoy some snacks while you drink. This helps to slow down the effect of alcohol on your body. <br>

4.	It will help you cut down the number of units you consume and avoid a hangover the next day. Drink water regularly whilst you’re out drinking and also when you get home to keep hydrated.<br> 

5.	The guidelines are lower than you might think – women should not regularly drink more than 1 standard drinks per day and men 2. <br>

6.	Aim to have at least 2 alcohol-free days every week to give your body a break. <br>

7.	The strength of drinks varies dramatically depending on what you’re drinking. So make sure you know how many standard drinks of alcohol are in your drink, and keep tabs on your intake. A cocktail can contain as many as 1.5 standard drinks of alcohol, while a 750ml bottle of table wine (12% vol) totals 5 standard drinks of alcohol<br> 

8.	Use a unit measure cup to keep track of how much you’re pouring at home. <br>

9.	Try keeping a drinking diary, noting how much you drank and where and you’ll get a better idea of your alcohol intake.<br> 

10.	Try to avoid multi-buy offers. Their prices might tempt you, but so will the big quantities of alcohol you’ll have in the cupboard.<br> 

11.	Drink familiar drinks in familiar places with familiar people<br>

12.	Don’t drink anything that you don’t know<br>

13.	Use the buddy system when drinking <br>

14.	Avoid drinking games<br>

15.	No drinking before driving<br>

16.	Plan to sleep over if you drove (put your keys away)<br>

17.	Drinking games may seem fun at the time but often lead to rapid overdrinking that in effect increases risks of not-so-good consequences of drinking<br>

18.	Drinking games are exciting and have risk of the competition, it is easy to lose track of how much is drunk.<br>

19.	Goal of the game, to drink a lot in a short amount of time, also means that blood alcohol level will be rapidly on the rise, placing participants at risk for blackouts, embarrassing behavior while in blackouts, and risk of injury due to poor coordination and judgment (see alcohol myopia).<br> 

20.	Drinking unknown amounts or types of alcohol prevents observing when you have had enough. Knowing exactly what you are putting into your body is a good thing!<br>

21.	Use the buddy system when drinking, which simply means taking along a friend or friends to drinking events.<br>

22.	There is strength in numbers, and having a friend watching your back while you are watching theirs increases the likelihood of a good time.<br> 

23.	The best strategy is not to drive to drinking events, and not to ride with others who have been drinking.<br>

24.	If you do drive to a party in which you plan to drink, make plans to spend the night and sleep off the effects of alcohol.<br>
25.	Make sure that your keys are safe so you will not be tempted to drive after you have been drinking (and after alcohol myopia sets in).<br>

26.	Well-known strategies, the ideas of arranging rides and using designated drivers.<br>

27.	Ask drivers if they drank alcohol.<br>

28.	Carry extra money to parties and drinking venues if a taxi is needed.<br>

29.	Avoiding driving after drinking, which is perhaps the most risky not-so-good thing about drinking.<br>

30.	Taking some to think about and plan drinking often leads to positive drinking experiences because planning tends to reduce the risk of over drinking.<br> 

31.	 Drinking too much, including binge drinking, cost $746 per person, or $1.90 a drink, in the US in 2006. These costs include health care expenses, crime, and lost productivity.<br>


32.	Drinking too much contributes to over 54 different injuries and diseases, including car crashes, violence, and sexually-transmitted diseases.<br>

33.	The chance of getting sick and dying from alcohol problems increases significantly for those who binge drink more often and drink more when they do.<br>

34.	A few ways to manage stress are to get enough sleep , avoid drugs and alcohol, connect socially and also take time for yourself.<br>

35.	Follow an eating plan with portions from the basic food groups. Also be aware that beverages may be adding extra calories.<br>

36.	Be creative about ways to get in exercise like walking across campus instead of driving, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and working out with a friend, group or joining an intramural sports team.<br>

37.	The best thing you can do is to drink plenty of water, eat a potassium rich snack like a banana and go for a stroll to get some fresh air.<br>

38.	Strong, healthy nails rely on a balanced intake of nutrients and plenty of water. Brittle nails could be one sign you’re drinking more than you think.<br>

39.	 Your hair also relies on your body being hydrated. Regular drinking can leave you with dry and brittle hair. Excessive drinking depletes iron and can cause hair loss.<br>

40.	A few too many drinks before bedtime and you might think you’re getting off to sleep quickly, but an excess of alcohol means you can go straight into deep sleep missing out the usual first stage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Instead of having typically 6-7 cycles of REM sleep you’ll only have 1-2 meaning you’ll wake up feeling tired.<br>

41.	Drinking also causes heartburn and because it relaxes the muscles in your body including the throat, it increases your likelihood of snoring. For a great night’s sleep, make that nightcap a glass of water.’<br>

42.	Alcohol can do more than leave you struggling to remember the events of the night before. Over time, heavy drinking can lead to memory loss problems – in particular, a Vitamin B1 deficiency causes Wernicke-Korsakoff's Syndrome – a dementia-like illness.<br>

43.	People who drink too much are often overweight - and as a result, can go on to develop diabetes. Although the condition is manageable, diabetes can reduce your lifespan and require a careful diet as well as daily medication or insulin injections.<br>

44.	Drinking in moderation can help to lower your risk of heart attack and stroke.<br>
45.	 For both men and women, too much alcohol lowers your fertility. As few as five drinks a week reduces a woman's chance of becoming pregnant and in men regularly drinking too much can lower sperm count.<br>

46.	  Plan ahead and carry a condom with you, it could decrease your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, or having an unwanted pregnancy.<br>

47.	Don’t accept drinks from strangers and watch your drink at all times.<br>

48.	If you’re being provoked by someone who has been drinking, the best advice is to walk away.<br>

49.	 People who fall asleep outside after drinking alcohol are at risk of hypothermia and even death. Even if you’re still awake, if it’s a cold night and you’re not dressed for the weather, there’s still a risk of hypothermia.<br>

50.	 Finding a taxi can be difficult late at night, so you might want to book one in advance. Make sure you have some money in hand to pay for it. If you're walking, walk with someone you know and trust.<br>

51.	 If you have to walk alone, stick to well-lit and well-used routes and keep your mobile handy. Let someone know what you're doing if you can and call them when you get home.<br>

52.	 Try to find ways to get out and have fun that don't always involve alcohol.<br>

53.	Avoid drinking in rounds and don't be pushed into drinking more than you'd like to.<br>

54.	If you're feeling the pressure to drink when you're out, there are lots of tricks you can use such as alternating 'or spacing' alcohol with soft drinks or water, or ordering a small glass of wine rather than a large one to stop you from overdoing it.<br>

55.	Eat a good meal before you start drinking, or enjoy some snacks while you drink. This helps to slow down the effect of alcohol on your body.<br>

56.	Aim to have at least 2 alcohol-free days every week to give your body a break.<br>

57.	Try keeping a drinking diary, noting how much you drank and where and you’ll get a better idea of your alcohol intake.<br>

	            <p>It’s the world’s most used drug, and the drug that most frequently sends users to the emergency room, and yet less than 60 percent of heavy drinkers recognize that their habits put them at high risk, according to the 2014 Global Drug Survey.</p><br>
				<p>Whether it’s because of alcohol’s celebratory feel or — in moderation — its health benefits or simply its ubiquity in social gatherings, many drinkers just don’t take their drinking seriously. We asked Kenneth R. Warren, Ph.D., deputy director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), to help set the record straight.</p>

				  <div id="demo30" class="collapse">
				      <div>
				      	  <p>You’ve probably heard the theory that our bodies naturally process a drink an hour. But actually, says Warren, it’s more like two hours. “The average rate of alcohol metabolism is 100 milligrams of alcohol per kilogram of bodyweight per hour,” he says. “For a typical 160-pound man, this would translate into 7 grams of alcohol in an hour. The so-called standard serving, a 12-ounce bottle of beer, is 14 grams of alcohol, so it would take two hours to fully metabolize it. For most people, if you drink one drink an hour, you’re going to become more and more impaired each hour.” For that 160-pound person, he says, at the rate of one drink an hour, four hours of drinking is enough to get you to a blood alcohol concentration of .08 — aka legally drunk.</p><br>

				      <div>
				      	  <p>Nothing speeds up the process, not a hot cup of coffee nor a cold shower. Caffeine can actually do more harm than good, says Warren. “Caffeine is a stimulant, and because of that, a person’s going to be more awake but just as much impaired,” he says. “It can give an individual a false degree of confidence that they are not impaired,” he says, which could lead to riskier behavior and dangerous decisions.</p><br>

				      <div>
				      	  <p>Drinking alcohol will send you to the bathroom more frequently than if you abstained. Booze suppresses the hormone vasopressin, which means more liquid than usual is redirected to the bladder. Alcohol is also a diuretic, so more water is squeezed out of each cell in our bodies when we drink. That extra fluid is also sent to the bladder. Suddenly, you’ve really got to go — and as you continue drinking, the amount of fluids you need to get rid of only increases. But! It has nothing to do with how long you postpone your first trip.</p><br>

				      <div>
				      	  <p>In reality, you’re probably finding yourself in the throes of a wicked hangover because of the total amount of alcohol you consumed, not the order in which you consumed it, the New York Times reported. “The pattern, more often, is that people will have beer and then move on to liquor at the end of the night, and so they think it’s the liquor that made them sick,” Carlton K. Erickson, director of the Addiction Science Research and Education Center at the University Of Texas College Of Pharmacy, told the Times in 2006. “But simply mixing the two really has nothing to do with it.”</p><br>

				      	  <p>It certainly can — but so can anything you consume in excess. That stereotypical beer-drinker’s gut is a sign you’re overdoing it on something, but not necessarily beer. “[M]ost beer bellies are just due to excessive calories from any source, beer among them,” Marion Nestle, Ph.D., M.P.H., a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University told The Huffington Post in 2013.</p><br>

				      	  <p>At one point or another, we’ve likely all heard a frat brother brag about waking up across the quad from last night’s rager — as if passing out was simply a level of intoxication and not a life-threatening situation. “Alcohol poisoning is drinking a sufficient amount of alcohol to suppress the central nervous system so that an individual stops required bodily functions,” says Warren. Reflexes that keep us alive — like coughing, gagging, breathing — can be shut down completely, which can cause death directly, or, as is more common, can cause someone who vomits to inhale the vomit and drown. “People have to know how much they are drinking and make sure they do not put their life at risk,” says Warren.</p><br>

Depending on your weight, you can have a BAC of 0.02% after only one drink, which can slow your reaction time and make it difficult to concentrate on two things simultaneously. A BAC of 0.03% can significantly impair your steering. At 0.04% your vision begins to focus on the center of the road and you cannot respond as well to street signs, traffic signals and pedestrians. By 0.05% your driving will be noticeably erratic, especially to the police.</p>

Once your brain has been depressed enough by the alcohol, you pass out. The amount of alcohol it takes to make you pass out is dangerously close to the amount of alcohol it takes to make you dead!</p>

				          <p><strong>Fact:</strong>Although this is partly true, the fact is that a drunk person is helpless and must be cared for. DO NOT LEAVE A DRUNK (INTOXICATED) PERSON ALONE!! Stay with the person, check their breathing, check their skin temperature, and frequently try to wake them.</p><br>
						  <p>“But if my friend passed out, I wouldn’t call for help. I couldn’t live with myself if I got them in trouble.”</p><br>
						  <p>Truth: If you don’t call for help, your friend may not live to be mad at you. When someone passes out from drinking too much, they are unconscious and have consumed too much alcohol. This person is suffering from alcohol poisoning and needs medical attention. If you are at all concerned, call 911 and get immediate help.</p>

				          <p><strong>Fact:</strong>Alcohol can act as both a stimulant and a depressant. The “point of diminishing return” is the BAC that is the peak of the stimulation and euphoria. At this point (.06) alcohol acts as a stimulant. Any higher BAC will result in fewer positive effects. Once the drinker has gone beyond the “point of diminishing return,” it is impossible to return back into the buzzed zone.</p><br>
				          <p>When a person consumes too much alcohol their body’s natural response is to get sleepy, heart rate and blood pressure decrease and breathing slows down. However, caffeine is also a stimulant so it helps to keep your body awake. This is a dangerous mix because the caffeine tricks your body into thinking it is not tired and that you are not as drunk as you really are. Therefore people who drink alcohol and caffeine are more likely to consume more alcohol in one sitting that a person who just drinks alcohol. This increases the risk of alcohol overdose and other risky behaviors.</p><br>

				      	  <strong>Women and Alcohol</strong><br><br>
Women absorb alcohol into the bloodstream faster and metabolize it slower than men.<br>

Women who drink regularly are at significantly greater risk for liver damage than men even if they drink less or drink for a shorter period of time.<br>

Women develop alcoholic liver disease after a comparatively shorter period of heavy drinking and at a lower level of daily drinking than men.<br>

Proportionately more alcoholic women die from cirrhosis than do alcoholic men.<br>

The odds of women experiencing sexual aggression were nine times higher on heavy days of alcohol consumption compared with days of no alcohol consumption.<br>

There is a greater incidence of alcohol misuse in women with eating disorders, especially bulimia, than in the general population.<br>

Girls who start dieting in sixth grade are more likely to engage in alcohol misuse later in life.<br>

A growing body of literature shows that substance abuse among women and the issues surrounding their abuse differ from that among men.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol and Athletic Ability </strong><br><br>
Moderate use (2-3 drinks) can results a loss of motor coordination for up to 12 to 18 hours after drinking<br>

Moderate use (2-3 drinks) can also result in depleted aerobic capacity and negative impact on endurance for up to 48 hours after the last drink has been consumed.<br><br>

<strong>Unintentional Injury</strong><br><br>
Alcohol consumption by college students is linked to at least 1,400 student deaths and 500,000 unintentional injuries each year.<br>

Evidence links a high proportion of deaths from falls, fires and burns and drownings to drinking.<br>

Various studies estimate that between 13% and 63% of falls are alcohol related.<br>

A common cause of fire among intoxicated people is falling asleep or passing out before extinguishing a cigarette.<br>

Alcohol is the number one date rape drug.<br>

More than three-quarters of female victims of nonfatal domestic violence reported that their assailant had been drinking or using drugs.<br><br>

<strong>Tolerance</strong><br><br>
Alcohol does not relieve depression - it makes it worse.<br>

Tolerance is the lessening of the effectiveness of alcohol after a period of prolonged or heavy use.<br>

Tolerance means you may not feel the same effects of alcohol as you continue to use, but your blood alcohol concentration level may remain high.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol and Depression</strong><br><br>
One third of suicides are associated with alcohol misuse.<br>

Approximately 5% of college students report experiencing poor mental health and this coincides with a high risk for alcohol abuse.<br>

Ages 18-24 coincides with the peak years for onset and intensification of the most common mental health problems among youth - including alcohol abuse.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol and the Body</strong><br><br>
Alcohol goes directly to the bloodstream, which is why it effects every system in the body.<br>

Excessive drinking can decrease the amount of testosterone in a man's body and cause impotence.<br>

Alcohol is a nervous system depressant.<br>

Alcohol is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestine, and less rapidly from the stomach and colon.<br>

A pulse rate lower than 40 is a medical emergency. Call 911!<br>

A respiration (breaths) rate lower than 8-10 per minute is a medical emergency. Call 911!<br>

A daily glass of wine will add 10 pounds per year.<br>

The peak Blood Alcohol Level occurs 60 to 90 minutes after ingestion when the stomach is empty.<br>

The presence of food in the stomach slows the rate of alcohol absorption. However the amount of alcohol absorbed remains unchanged.<br>

Vomiting is part of the automatic defense system of the body activated to prevent more alcohol from being absorbed.<br>

When a person's blood alcohol level ranges from .02 g/100ml to .08 g/100ml he/she usually has a change in mood and may have trouble interpreting what he/she sees and hears.<br>

Birth control pills slow down the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the body<br>

If someone passes out and will not respond to attempts to wake them, it is very possible they are suffering from alcohol poisoning.<br>

Several factors influence how alcohol will affect a person: age, gender, physical condition, amount of food eaten and other drugs or medicines taken.<br>

The path of alcohol in the body is the mouth, stomach, small intestine, heart, brain and the liver.<br>

Individuals with the same weight, but different muscle builds will differ in their BAC.<br>

Individuals with more muscle are less affected by alcohol because the muscle contains water that absorbs the alcohol from the bloodstream.<br>

Premenstrual hormonal changes cause a faster increase in BAC during the days right before a woman gets her period.<br><br>

<strong>Chronic Alcohol Use</strong><br><br>
Chronic alcohol use can damage the frontal lobes of the brain.<br>

Chronic alcohol use can cause an overall reduction in brain size.<br>

Pregnant women who drink risk having babies with fetal alcohol syndrome.<br>

Babies born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have: smaller heads and brains, some degree of mental retardation, poor coordination, hyperactivity and abnormal facial features.<br>

10% of alcohol health care costs are for care of fetal alcohol syndrome.<br><br>

<strong>Adult Drinking Behaviors</strong><br><br>
Binge Drinking is more common in men than in women.<br>
Six in 10 U.S. adults were current drinkers in 1999-2001 and about 1 in 4 were lifetime abstainers.<br>

Nearly one-third of adults were classified as light drinkers (3 or fewer drinks per week).<br>
Nearly 5 percent of adults were classified as heavier drinkers (7 or more drinks per week for women; 14 or more for men).<br>

About 20 percent of adults had 5 or more drinks per day at least once in the past year.<br><br>

<strong>Definitions</strong><br><br>
Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the amount of alcohol present in the blood when consuming alcohol.<br>

A blackout is an amnesia-like period that is often associated with drinking. A person may be functioning normally, but later, the person has no memory of occurrences.<br>

During a blackout, an individual can participate in a significant, emotionally charged event but have no recollection of what occurred.<br>

When blood alcohol levels rise slowly, people are less likely to experience blackouts, even if they eventually become intoxicated.<br><br>

<strong>Alcohol Beverage Facts</strong><br>
Most wine coolers have the same amount of alcohol as a 12-oz. beer.<br>

One 12-oz. beer, one 5-oz. glass of wine and one 1.5 oz. shot of liquor have the same amount of alcohol.<br>
